    <h2>
      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Eleven years ago my little book on the antiquities of English villages was
      published. Its object was to interest our rustic neighbours in their
      surroundings, to record the social life of the people at various times&mdash;their
      feasts and fairs, sports and pastimes, faiths and superstitions&mdash;and
      to describe the scenes which once took place in the fields and lanes they
      know so well. A friendly reviewer remarked that the wonder was that a book
      of that kind had never been written before, and that that was the first
      attempt to give a popular and readable sketch of the history and
      associations of our villages. In the present work I have attempted to fill
      in the sketch with greater detail, and to write not only for the villagers
      themselves, but for all those who by education are able to take a more
      intelligent interest in the study of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the last decade many village histories have been written, and if
      this book should be of service to anyone who is compiling the chronicles
      of some rural world, or if it should induce some who have the necessary
      leisure and ability to undertake such works, it will not have been written
      in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most distressing features of modern village life is the
      continual decrease of the population. The rural exodus is an alarming and
      very real danger to the welfare of social England. The country is
      considered dull and life therein dreary both by squire and peasant alike.
      Hence the attractions of towns or the delights of travel empty our
      villages. The manor-house is closed and labourers are scarce. To increase
      the attractions of our villages, to arouse an interest in their past
      history and social life, is worth attempting; and perhaps this Story may
      be of some use in fostering local patriotism, and in reconciling those who
      spend their lives far from the busy hives of men to their lot, when they
      find how much interest lies immediately around them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The study of archaeology has been pursued with much vigour during recent
      years, and increased knowledge has overthrown the many wild theories and
      conjectures which were gravely pronounced to be ascertained facts by the
      antiquaries of fifty years ago. Gildas, Geoffrey of Monmouth, or Richard
      of Cirencester are no longer accepted as safe and infallible guides. We
      know that there were such people as the Druids, but we no longer attribute
      to them the great stone circles nor imagine them sacrificing on &ldquo;Druid&rsquo;s
      altars,&rdquo; as our forefathers called the dolmens. The history of
      Britain no longer begins with the advent of Julius Caesar, nor is his
      account of the Celtic tribes and their manners accepted as a full and
      complete statement of all that is known about them. The study of flint
      implements, of barrows and earthworks, has considerably thrown back our
      historical horizon and enabled us to understand the conditions of life in
      our island in the early days of a remote past before the dawn of history.
      The systematic excavation of Silchester, so ably conducted by the Society
      of Antiquaries, and of other Roman sites of towns and villas, enables us
      to realise more clearly the history of Britain under the rule of the
      Empire; and the study of the etymology of place-names has overthrown many
      of the absurd derivations which found a place in the old county histories,
      and are often repeated by the writers of modern guide books. Moreover
      patient labour amid old records, rolls, and charters, has vastly increased
      our knowledge of the history of manors; and the ancient parish registers
      and churchwardens&rsquo; account books have been made to yield their store
      of information for the benefit of industrious students and scholars. There
      has been much destruction and much construction; and this good work will
      doubtless continue, until at length English archaeology may be dignified
      with the title of an exact science. Destruction of another kind is much to
      be deplored, which has left its mark on many an English village. The
      so-called &ldquo;restoration&rdquo; of ancient parish churches, frequently
      conducted by men ignorant of the best traditions of English architecture,
      the obliteration of the old architectural features, the entire destruction
      of many interesting buildings, have wrought deplorable ruin in our
      villages, and severed the links with the past which now can never be
      repaired. The progress of antiquarian knowledge will I trust arrest the
      destroyer&rsquo;s hand and prevent any further spoliation of our
      diminished inheritance. If this book should be found useful in stimulating
      an intelligent interest in architectural studies, and in protecting our
      ancient buildings from such acts of vandalism, its purpose will have been
      abundantly achieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am indebted to many friends and acquaintances for much information which
      has been useful to me in writing this book; to Sir John Evans whose works
      are invaluable to all students of ancient stone and bronze implements; to
      Dr. Cox whose little book on <i>How to Write the History of a Parish</i>
      is a sure and certain guide to local historians; to Mr. St. John Hope and
      Mr. Fallow for much information contained in their valuable monograph on
      <i>Old Church Plate</i>; to the late Dr. Stevens, of Reading; to Mr.
      Shrubsole of the same town; to Mr. Gibbins, the author of <i>The
      Industrial History of England</i>, for the use of an illustration from his
      book; to Mr. Melville, Mr. P.J. Colson, and the Rev. W. Marshall for their
      photographic aid; and to many other authors who are only known to me by
      their valuable works. To all of these gentlemen I desire to express my
      thanks, and also to Mr. Mackintosh for his artistic sketch of a typical
      English village, which forms the frontispiece of my book.

      INTRODUCTION
    </h3>
    <p>
      Local histories&mdash;Ignorance and destruction&mdash;Advantages of the
      study of village antiquities&mdash;Description of an English village&mdash;The
      church&mdash; The manor-house&mdash;Prehistoric people&mdash;Later
      inhabitants&mdash;Saxons&mdash;Village inn&mdash;Village green&mdash;Legends.
    </p>
    <p>
      To write a complete history of any village is one of the hardest literary
      labours which anyone can undertake. The soil is hard, and the crop after
      the expenditure of much toil is often very scanty. In many cases the
      records are few and difficult to discover, buried amidst the mass of
      papers at the Record Office, or entombed in some dusty corner of the
      Diocesan Registry. Days may be spent in searching for these treasures of
      knowledge with regard to the past history of a village without any
      adequate result; but sometimes fortune favours the industrious toiler, and
      he discovers a rich ore which rewards him for all his pains. Slowly his
      store of facts grows, and he is at last able to piece together the history
      of his little rural world, which time and the neglect of past generations
      had consigned to dusty oblivion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In recent years several village histories have been written with varied
      success by both competent and incompetent scribes; but such books are few
      in number, and we still have to deplore the fact that so little is known
      about the hamlets in which we live. All writers seem to join in the same
      lament, and mourn over the ignorance that prevails in rural England with
      regard to the treasures of antiquity, history, and folklore, which are to
      be found almost everywhere. We may still echo the words of the learned
      author of <i>Tom Brown&rsquo;s Schooldays</i>, the late Mr. Hughes, who
      said that the present generation know nothing of their own birthplaces, or
      of the lanes, woods, and fields through which they roam. Not one young man
      in twenty knows where to find the wood-sorrel, or the bee-orchis; still
      fewer can tell the country legends, the stories of the old gable-ended
      farmhouses, or the place where the last skirmish was fought in the Civil
      War, or where the parish butts stood. Nor is this ignorance confined to
      the unlearned rustics; it is shared by many educated people, who have
      travelled abroad and studied the history of Rome or Venice, Frankfort or
      Bruges, and yet pass by unheeded the rich stores of antiquarian lore,
      which they witness every day, and never think of examining closely and
      carefully. There are very few villages in England which have no objects of
      historical interest, no relics of the past which are worthy of
      preservation. &ldquo;Restoration,&rdquo; falsely so called, conducted by
      ignorant or perverse architects, has destroyed and removed many features
      of our parish churches; the devastating plough has well-nigh levelled many
      an ancient barrow; railroads have changed the character of rustic life and
      killed many an old custom and rural festival. Old legends and quaint
      stories of the countryside have given place to talks about politics and
      newspaper gossip. But still much remains if we learn to examine things for
      ourselves, and endeavour to gather up the relics of the past and save them
      from the destructive hand of Time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great service may thus be rendered not only to the cause of history, but
      also to the villagers of rural England, by those who have time, leisure,
      and learning, sufficient to gain some knowledge of bygone times. It adds
      greatly to the interest of their lives to know something of the place
      where they live; and it has been well said that every man&rsquo;s concern
      with his native place has something more in it than the amount of rates
      and taxes that he has to pay. He may not be able to write a history of his
      parish, but he can gather up the curious gossip of the neighbourhood, the
      traditions and stories which have been handed down from former
      generations. And if anyone is at the pains to acquire some knowledge of
      local history, and will impart what he knows to his poorer neighbours, he
      will add greatly to their interest in life. Life is a burden, labour mere
      drudgery, when a man has nothing in which he can interest himself. When we
      remember the long hours which an agricultural labourer spends alone,
      without a creature to speak to, except his horses or the birds, we can
      imagine how dull his life must be, if his mind be not occupied. But here,
      on his own ground, he may find an endless supply of food for thought,
      which will afford him much greater pleasure and satisfaction than thinking
      and talking about his neighbours&rsquo; faults, reflecting upon his
      wrongs, or imitating the example of one of his class who, when asked by
      the squire what he was thinking so deeply about, replied, &ldquo;Mostly
      naught.&rdquo; To remove the pall of ignorance that darkens the rustic
      mind, to quicken his understanding and awaken his interest, are certainly
      desirable objects; although his ignorance is very often shared by his
      betters, who frequently hazard very strange theories and manifest many
      curious ideas with regard to village antiquities.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will walk together through the main roads of the village, and observe
      some of its many points of interest. Indeed, it is no small thing to live
      in such a &ldquo;city of memories&rdquo; as every village is, when at
      every turn and corner we meet with something that reminds us of the past,
      and recalls the pleasing associations of old village life. To those who
      have lived amid the din and turmoil of a large town, where everybody is in
      a hurry, and there is nothing but noise, confusion, and bustle, the
      delicious calm and quietude of an old English village, undisturbed by the
      world&rsquo;s rude noise, is most grateful. But to live in memory of what
      has gone before, of the lives and customs of our forefathers, of the
      strange events that have happened on the very ground upon which we are
      standing, all this will make us love our village homes and delight in them
      exceedingly. In most of our large towns the old features are fast
      disappearing; historical houses have been pulled down to make room for
      buildings more adapted to present needs, and everything is being
      modernised; but in the country everything remains the same, and it is not
      so difficult to let one&rsquo;s thoughts wander into the past, and picture
      to one&rsquo;s self the old features of village life in bygone times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of our villages have the usual common features, and it is not
      difficult to describe a typical example, though the details vary very
      much, and the histories of no two villages are identical. We see arising
      above the trees the church, the centre of the old village life, both
      religious, secular, and social. It stands upon a site which has been
      consecrated to the service of God for many centuries. There is possibly in
      or near the churchyard a tumulus, or burial mound, which shows that the
      spot was set apart for some religious observances even before Christianity
      reached our shores. Here the early Saxon missionary planted his cross and
      preached in the open air to the gathered villagers. Here a Saxon thane
      built a rude timber church which was supplanted by an early Norman
      structure of stone with round arches and curiously carved ornamentation.
      This building has been added to at various times, and now shows, writ in
      stone, its strange and varied history. The old time-worn registers, kept
      in the parish chest in the vestry, breathe the atmosphere of bygone times,
      and tell the stories and romances of the &ldquo;rude forefathers of the
      hamlet.&rdquo; The tombs and monuments of knights and ancient heroes tell
      many a tale of valour and old-world prowess, of families that have
      entirely died out, of others that still happily remain amongst us, and
      record the names and virtues of many an illustrious house. The windows,
      brasses, bells, and inscriptions, have all some interesting story to
      relate, which we hope presently to examine more minutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nestling amid the trees we see the manor-house, standing probably on the
      site of a much older edifice; and this building carries our thoughts back
      to the Saxon and early Norman times, when the lord of the manor had
      vassals and serfs under him, held his manorial court, and reigned as a
      king in his own small domain. The history of the old English manor is a
      very important one, concerning which much has been written, many questions
      disputed, and some points still remain to be decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we notice an old farmhouse which has doubtless seen better days, for
      there are the remains of an ancient moat around it, as if some family of
      importance once lived there, and wished to guard themselves and their
      possessions from troublesome visitors. This moat tells of the times of war
      and lawlessness, of wild and fierce animals roaming the countryside; and
      if the walls of the old house could speak how many stories could they tell
      of the strange customs of our ancestors, of bread riots, of civil wars,
      and disturbances which once destroyed the tranquillity of our peaceful
      villages!
    </p>
    <p>
      We shall endeavour to discover the earliest inhabitants of our villages
      who left their traces behind in the curious stone and bronze weapons of
      war or domestic implements, and who lived in far remote periods before the
      dawn of history. The barrows, or tumuli, which contain their dead bodies
      tell us much about them; and also the caves and lake dwellings help us to
      form some very accurate notions of the conditions of life in those distant
      days. We shall see that the Britons or Celts were far from being the naked
      woad-dyed savages described by Caesar, whose account has so long been
      deemed sufficient by the historians of our childhood. We shall call to
      mind the many waves of invaders which rolled over our country&mdash;the
      Celts, the Romans, Saxons, Danes, and Normans&mdash;all of whom have left
      some traces behind them, and added sundry chapters to the story of our
      villages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fields too proclaim their story, and tell us of the Saxon folk who
      were our first farmers, and made clearings in the forests, and tilled the
      same soil we work to-day. They tell us too of the old monks who knew so
      much about agriculture; and occasionally the plough turns up a rusty sword
      or cannon ball, which reveals the story of battles and civil wars which we
      trust have passed away from our land for ever. The very names of the
      fields are not without signification, and tell us of animals which are now
      extinct, of the manners of our forefathers, of the old methods of farming,
      and the common lands which have passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old village inn, with its curiously painted signboard, has its own
      story to tell, of the old coaching days, and of the great people who used
      to travel along the main roads, and were sometimes snowed up in a drift
      just below &ldquo;The Magpie,&rdquo; which had always good accommodation
      for travellers, and stabling for fifty horses. All was activity in the
      stable yard when the coach came in; the villagers crowded round the inn
      doors to see the great folks from London who were regaling themselves with
      well-cooked English joints; and if they stayed all night, could find
      comfortable beds with lavender-scented sheets, and every attention. But
      the railroads and iron steeds have changed all that; until yesterday the
      roads were deserted, and the glory of the old inns departed. Bicyclists
      now speed along in the track of the old coaches; but they are not quite so
      picturesque, and the bicycle bell is less musical than the cheerful
      posthorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the summit of a neighbouring hill we see a curious formation which is
      probably an earthwork, constructed many centuries ago by the early
      dwellers in this district for the purpose of defence in dangerous times,
      when the approach of a neighbouring tribe, or the advance of a company of
      free-booting invaders, threatened them with death or the destruction of
      their flocks and herds. These earthworks we shall examine more closely. An
      ivy-covered ruin near the church shows the remains of a monastic cell or
      monastery; and in the distance perhaps we can see the outlines of an old
      Norman keep or castle; all of these relate to the story of our villages,
      and afford us subjects for investigation and research.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there is the village green where so many generations of the villagers
      have disported themselves, danced the old country dances (now alas!
      forgotten), and reared the merry May-pole, and crowned their queen. Here
      they held their rural sports, and fought their bouts of quarter-staff and
      cudgel-play, grinned through horse-collars, and played pipe and tabor at
      many a rustic feast, when life was young and England merry. We shall try
      to picture to ourselves these happy scenes of innocent diversion which
      cheered the hearts of our forefathers in bygone times.

      <br />AN ENGLISH VILLAGE STREET <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      We will try to collect the curious legends and stories which were told to
      us by our grandsires, and are almost forgotten by the present generation.
      These we should treasure up, lest they should be for ever lost. Local
      tradition has often led the way to important discoveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this brief circuit of an ordinary English village we have found many
      objects which are calculated to excite our imagination and to stimulate
      inquiry. A closer examination will well repay our study, and reward the
      labour of the investigator. It is satisfactory to know that all possible
      discoveries as to the antiquities of our villages have not yet been made.
      We have still much to learn, and the earth has not yet disclosed all its
      treasures. Roman villas still remain buried; the sepulchres of many a
      Saxon chieftain or early nomad Celt are still unexplored; the pile
      dwellings and cave domiciles of the early inhabitants of our country have
      still to be discovered; and piles of records and historical documents have
      still to be sought out, arranged, and examined. So there is much work to
      be done by the antiquary for many a long year; and every little discovery,
      and the results of every patient research, assist in accumulating that
      store of knowledge which is gradually being compiled by the hard labour of
      our English historians and antiquaries.

    </p>
    <p>
      It was customary some years ago to begin the history of any country with
      the statement, &ldquo;Of the early inhabitants nothing is known with any
      certainty,&rdquo; and to commence the history of England with the landing
      of Julius Caesar B.C. 55. If this book had been written forty or fifty
      years ago it might have been stated that our first knowledge of Britain
      dates from 330 B.C. when Pytheas of Marseilles visited it, and described
      his impressions. He says that the climate was foggy, a characteristic
      which it has not altogether lost, that the people cultivated the ground
      and used beer and mead as beverages. Our villagers still follow the
      example of their ancestors in their use of one at least of these drinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the history of all the ages prior to the advent of this Pytheas all
      written record is silent. Hence we have to play the part of scientific
      detectives, examine the footprints of the early man who inhabited our
      island, hunt for odds and ends which he has left behind, to rake over his
      kitchen middens, pick up his old tools, and even open his burial mound.
    </p>
    <p>
      About fifty years ago the attention of the scientific world was drawn to
      the flint implements which were scattered over the surface of our fields
      and in our gravel pits and mountain caves; and inquiring minds began to
      speculate as to their origin. The collections made at Amiens and Abbeville
      and other places began to convince men of the existence of an unknown and
      unimagined race, and it gradually dawned on us that on our moors and downs
      were the tombs of a race of men who fashioned their weapons of war and
      implements of peace out of flint. These discoveries have pushed back our
      knowledge of man to an antiquity formerly never dreamed of, and enlarged
      considerably our historical horizon. So we will endeavour to discover what
      kind of men they were, who roamed our fields and woods before any
      historical records were written, and mark the very considerable traces of
      their occupation which they have left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The condition of life and the character and climate of the country were
      very different in early times from what they are in the present day; and
      in endeavouring to discover the kind of people who dwelt here in
      prehistoric times, we must hear what the geologists have to tell us about
      the physical aspect of Britain in that period. There was a time when this
      country was connected with the Continent of Europe, and the English
      Channel and North Sea were mere valleys with rivers running through them
      fed by many streams. Where the North Sea now rolls there was the great
      valley of the Rhine; and as there were no ocean-waves to cross, animals
      and primitive man wandered northwards and westwards from the Continent,
      and made their abode here. It is curious to note that the migratory birds
      when returning to France and Italy, and thence to the sunny regions of
      Algiers and other parts of Northern Africa, always cross the seas where in
      remote ages there was dry land. They always traverse the same route; and
      it appears that the recollection of the places where their ancestors
      crossed has been preserved by them through all the centuries that have
      elapsed since &ldquo;the silver streak&rdquo; was formed that severs
      England from her neighbours.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the times of which we are speaking the land was much higher than it is
      now. Snowdon was 600 feet greater, and the climate was much colder and
      more rigorous. Glaciers like those in Switzerland were in all the higher
      valleys, and the marks of the action of the ice are still plainly seen on
      the rocky cliffs that border many a ravine. Moreover we find in the
      valleys many detached rocks, immense boulders, the nature of which is
      quite different from the character of the stone in the neighbourhood.
      These were carried down by the glaciers from higher elevations, and
      deposited, when the ice melted, in the lower valleys. Hence in this
      glacial period the condition of the country was very different from what
      it is now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a remarkable change took place. The land began to sink, and its
      elevation so much decreased that the central part of the country became a
      huge lake, and the peak of Snowdon was an island surrounded by the sea
      which washed with its waves the lofty shoulder of the mountain. This is
      the reason why shells and shingle are found in high elevations. The Ice
      Age passed away and the climate became warmer. The Gulf Stream found its
      way to our shores, and the country was covered by a warm ocean having
      islands raising their heads above the surface. Sharks swam around, whose
      teeth we find now buried in beds of clay. The land continued to rise, and
      attracted by the sunshine and the more genial clime animals from the
      Continent wandered northwards, and with them came man. Caves, now high
      amongst the hills, but then on a level with the rivers, were his first
      abode, and contain many relics of his occupancy, together with the bones
      of extinct animals. The land appears to have risen, and the climate became
      colder. The sea worked its relentless way through the chalk hills on the
      south and gradually met the waves of the North Sea which flowed over the
      old Rhine valley. It widened also the narrow strait that severed the
      country from Ireland, and the outline and contour of the island began more
      nearly to resemble that with which we are now familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      A vast period of time was necessary to accomplish all these immense
      changes; and it is impossible to speculate with any degree of certainty
      how long that period was, which transformed the icebound surface of our
      island to a land of verdure and wild forests. We must leave such
      conjectures and the more detailed accounts of the glacial and post-glacial
      periods to the geologists, as our present concern is limited to the study
      of the habits and condition of the men who roamed our fields and forests
      in prehistoric times. Although no page of history gives us any information
      concerning them, we can find out from the relics of arms and implements
      which the earth has preserved for us, what manner of men lived in the old
      cave dwellings, or constructed their rude huts, and lie buried beneath the
      vast barrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earliest race of men who inhabited our island was called the
      Palaeolithic race, from the fact that they used the most ancient form of
      stone implements. Traces of a still earlier race are said to have been
      discovered a few years ago on the chalk plateau of the North Down, near
      Sevenoaks. The flints have some slight hollows in them, as if caused by
      scraping, and denote that the users must have been of a very low condition
      of intelligence&mdash;able to use a tool but scarcely able to make one.
      This race has been called the Eolithic; but some antiquaries have thrown
      doubts upon their existence, and the discovery of these flints is too
      recent to allow us to speak of them with any degree of certainty.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br />PALAEOLITHIC IMPLEMENTS <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The traces of Palaeolithic man are very numerous, and he evidently
      exercised great skill in bringing his implements to a symmetrical shape by
      chipping. The use of metals for cutting purposes was entirely unknown; and
      stone, wood, and bone were the only materials of which these primitive
      beings availed themselves for the making of weapons or domestic
      implements. Palaeolithic man lived here during that distant period when
      this country was united with the Continent, and when the huge mammoth
      roamed in the wild forests, and powerful and fierce animals struggled for
      existence in the hills and vales of a cold and inclement country. His
      weapons and tools were of the rudest description, and made of chipped
      flint. Many of these have been found in the valley gravels, which had
      probably been dropped from canoes into the lakes or rivers, or washed down
      by floods from stations on the shore. Eighty or ninety feet above the
      present level of the Thames in the higher gravels are these relics found;
      and they are so abundant that the early inhabitants who used them must
      have been fairly numerous. Their shape is usually oval, and often pointed
      into a rude resemblance of the shape of a spear-head. Some flint-flakes
      are of the knifelike character; others resemble awls, or borers, with
      sharp points evidently for making holes in skins for the purpose of
      constructing a garment. Hammer-stones for crushing bones, tools with
      well-wrought flat edges, scrapers, and other implements, were the
      stock-in-trade of the earliest inhabitant of our country, and are
      distinguishable from those used by Neolithic man by their larger and
      rougher work. The maker of the old stone tools never polished his
      implements; nor did he fashion any of those finely wrought arrowheads and
      javelin points, upon which his successor prided himself. The latter
      discovered that the flints which were dug up were more easily fashioned
      into various shapes; whereas Palaeolithic man picked up the flints that
      lay about on the surface of the ground, and chipped them into the form of
      his rude tools. However, the elder man was acquainted with the use of
      fire, which he probably obtained by striking flints on blocks of iron
      pyrites. Wandering about the country in families and tribes, he contrived
      to exist by hunting the numerous animals that inhabited the primeval
      forests, and has left us his weapons and tools to tell us what kind of man
      he was. His implements are found in the drift gravels by the riversides;
      and from this cause his race are known as drift men, in order to
      distinguish them from the <i>cave men</i>, who seem to have belonged to a
      little later period.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first dwellings of man were the caves on the hillsides, before he
      found out the art of building pile huts. In Palaeolithic times these caves
      were inhabited by a rude race of feral nomads who lived by the chase, and
      fashioned the rude tools which we have already described. They were,
      however, superior to the drift men, and had some notion of art. The
      principal caves in the British islands containing the relics of the cave
      folk are the following: Perthichoaren, Denbighshire, wherein were found
      the remains of Platycnemic man&mdash;so named from his having sharp
      shin-bones; Cefn, St. Asaph; Uphill, Somerset; King&rsquo;s Scar and the
      Victoria Cave, Settle; Robin Hood&rsquo;s Cave and Pinhole Cave,
      Derbyshire; Black Rock, Caldy Island, Coygan Caves, Pembrokeshire; King
      Arthur&rsquo;s Cave, Monmouth; Durdham Downs, Bristol; and sundry others,
      near Oban, in the valleys of the Trent, Dove, and Nore, and of the Irish
      Blackwater, and in Caithness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these abodes the bones of both men and animals have been found; but
      these do not all belong to the same period, as the Neolithic people, and
      those of the Bronze and Iron Ages, followed the occupation of the earlier
      race. The remains of the different races, however, lie at various depths,
      those of the earlier race naturally lying the lowest. An examination of
      the Victoria Cave, Settle, clearly shows this. Outside the entrance there
      was found a layer of charcoal and burnt bones, and the burnt stones of
      fireplaces, pottery, coins of the Emperors Trajan and Constantine, and
      ornaments in bone, ivory, bronze and enamel. The animal remains were those
      of the <i>bos longifrons</i> (Celtic ox), pig, horse, roe, stag, fowl
      (wild), and grouse. This layer was evidently composed of the relics of a
      Romano-British people. Below this were found chipped flints, an adze of
      melaphyre, and a layer of boulders, sand, and clay, brought down by the
      ice from the higher valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the cave in the upper cave earth were found the bones of fox,
      badger, brown bear, grizzly bear, reindeer, red deer, horse, pig, and
      goat, and some bones evidently hacked by man. In the lower cave earth
      there were the remains of the hyena, fox, brown and grizzly bears,
      elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, urus, bison, and red deer, the hacked
      bones of a goat, and a small leg-bone of a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some idea of the time which has elapsed since primitive man inhabited this
      rude dwelling may be formed from these excavations. Two feet below the
      surface lay the Romano-British layer, and we know therefore that about
      1,600 years was required for the earth to accumulate to that depth. The
      Neolithic layer was six feet below this; hence 4,800 years would be
      necessary to form this depth of earth. So we may conclude that at least
      6,400 years ago Neolithic man used the cave. A long time previous to this
      lived the creatures of the lower cave earth, the bison, elephant, and the
      hyena with the solitary human bone, which belonged to the sharp-shinned
      race (Platycnemic) of beings, the earliest dwellers in our country.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is doubtful whether Palaeolithic man has left any descendants. The
      Esquimaux appear to somewhat resemble them. Professor Boyd Dawkins, in his
      remarkable book, <i>Cave Hunting</i>, traces this relationship in the
      character of implements, methods of obtaining food and cooking it, modes
      of preparing skins for clothing, and particularly in the remarkable skill
      of depicting figures on bone which both races display. In carving figures
      on bone and teeth early man in Britain was certainly more skilful than his
      successor; but he was a very inferior type of the human race, yet his
      intelligence and mode of life have been deemed not lower than those of the
      Australian aborigines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The animals which roamed through the country in this Pleistocene period
      were the elk and reindeer, which link us on to the older and colder period
      when Arctic conditions prevailed; the Irish deer, a creature of great size
      whose head weighed about eighty pounds; bison, elephant, rhinoceros,
      hippopotamus, lion, wolf, otter, bear, horse, red deer, roe, urus or
      gigantic ox, the short-horned ox (<i>bos longifrons</i>), boar, badger and
      many others which survive to the present day, and have therefore a very
      long line of ancestors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The successor of the old stone implement maker was Neolithic man, to whom
      we have already had occasion to refer. Some lengthy period of geological
      change separates him from his predecessor of the Old Stone Age. Specimens
      of his handiwork show that he was a much more civilised person than his
      predecessor, and presented a much higher type of humanity. He had a
      peculiarly shaped head, the back part of the skull being strangely
      prolonged; and from this feature he is called <i>dolichocephalic</i>. He
      was small in stature, about 5 feet 6 inches in height, having a dark
      complexion, and his descendants are the Iberian or Basque races in the
      Western Pyrenees and may still be traced in parts of Ireland and Wales.
      The long barrows or mounds, the length of which is greater than the
      breadth, contain his remains, and we find traces of his existence in all
      the western countries of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had made many discoveries which were unknown to his Old Stone
      predecessor. Instead of always hunting for his food, like an animal, he
      found out that the earth would give him corn with which he could make
      bread, if only he took the trouble to cultivate it. Instead of always
      slaying animals, he found that some were quite ready to be his servants,
      and give him milk and wool and food. He brought with him to our shores
      cows and sheep and goats, horses and dogs. Moreover he made pottery,
      moulding the clay with his hand, and baking it in a fire. He had not
      discovered the advantages of a kiln. He could spin thread, and weave
      stuffs, though he usually wore garments of skins.
    </p>
    <p>
      His dwellings were no longer the caves and forests, for he made for
      himself rude pit huts, and surrounded himself, his tribe, and cattle with
      a circular camp. Traces of his agricultural operations may still be found
      in the &ldquo;terraces,&rdquo; or strips of ground on hillsides, which
      preserve the marks of our early Neolithic farmers.

      Their implements are far superior to those of the Old Stone men, and are
      found on the surface of our fields, or on hillsides, where they tended
      their flocks, or dug their rude pit shelters. Their weapons and tools are
      highly polished, and have evidently been ground on a grindstone. They are
      adapted for an endless variety of uses, and are most skilfully and
      beautifully fashioned. There are finely wrought arrowheads, of three
      shapes&mdash;barbed, tanged and barbed, and leaf-shaped; axes, scrapers
      for cleansing and preparing skins for clothing, hammer stones, wedges,
      drills, borers, knives, and many other tools. In the Reading Museum may be
      seen a heavy quartzite axe and chipped flint hatchet, which were found
      with some charred timber on an island in the Thames, and were evidently
      used for scooping out the interior of a boat from a tree with the aid of
      fire. So this New Stone man knew how to make boats as well as a vast
      number of other things of which we shall presently speak more
      particularly. His descendants linger on in South Wales and Ireland, and
      are short in stature, dark in complexion, and narrow-skulled, like their
      forefathers a few thousand years ago.

      <br />NEOLITHIC AND BRONZE IMPLEMENTS <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Another wave of invaders swept over our land, and overcame the long-headed
      Neolithic race. These were the Celtic people, taller and stronger than
      their predecessors, and distinguished by their fair hair and rounded
      skulls. From the shape of their heads they are called Brachycephalic, and
      are believed to have belonged to the original Aryan race, whose birthplace
      was Southern Asia. At some remote period this wave of invaders poured over
      Europe and Asia, and has left traces behind it in the languages of all
      Indo-European nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their weapons were made of bronze, although they still used polished stone
      implements also. We find chisels, daggers, rings, buttons, and
      spear-heads, all made of bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, and fashioned
      by the skilled hands of these early Celtic folk. As they became more
      civilised, being of an inventive mind, they discovered the use of iron and
      found it a more convenient metal for fashioning axes to cut down trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Caesar came to Britain he found that the inhabitants knew the use of
      iron, even the less civilised early Celtic settlers driven northwards and
      westwards by the Belgae, had iron weapons, and the wild Caledonians in the
      time of Severus, although they were naked, woad-dyed savages, wore iron
      collars and girdles and were armed with metal weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such are some of the relics of antiquity which the soil of our native land
      retains, as a memorial of the primitive people who first trod upon it.
      Concerning their lives and records history is silent, until the Conqueror
      tells us something of our Celtic forefathers. From the scanty remains of
      prehistoric races, their weapons and tools, we can gather something of the
      earliest inhabitants of our island, and try to realise their habits and
      mode of life.

      TUMULI OR BARROWS

    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the country we find many artificial mounds which are called <i>tumuli</i>
      or barrows, or in the neighbourhood of Wales, &ldquo;tumps.&rdquo; These
      are the ancient burial-places of the early inhabitants of our island, the
      word &ldquo;barrow&rdquo; being derived from the Anglo-Saxon <i>beorh</i>,
      a hill or grave-mound. It is not unusual to see a barrow in the centre, or
      near, an old churchyard, as at Taplow, Bucks. The church was built, of
      course, much later than the erection of the mound; but doubtless the early
      preachers of the gospel took advantage of the reverence which was paid to
      these ancient tombs, proclaimed there the story of the cross, and on the
      spots so consecrated churches were ultimately built.
    </p>
    <p>
      These mounds have much to tell us of the early inhabitants. To cover the
      dead with a mound of earth was a custom common to all nations. All over
      Europe, in Northern Asia, India, and in the new world of America, we find
      burial-mounds. The pyramids of Egypt are only glorified mounds; and our
      islands can boast of an endless variety, sometimes consisting of cairns,
      or heaps of stones, sometimes of huge hills of earth, 130 feet in height,
      as at Silbury, Wilts, and covering five acres; while others are only small
      heaps of soil a few feet high.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contents of the tumuli differ also. Sometimes the bodies were burnt
      and the ashes preserved in rude urns; sometimes they were not cremated.
      Sometimes they were buried in stone cists, or in the hollowed trunk of
      trees; sometimes without any covering save that of the earth. In nearly
      all cases we find numerous articles buried with the dead, such as personal
      ornaments, weapons, pottery, and food.
    </p>
    <p>
      The presence of food in the tumuli testifies to the natural instinct
      implanted by the Creator in the human heart with regard to a future
      existence. The idea that the soul of the departed is about to take a long
      journey is constant and deeply rooted; the rainbow and the milky way have
      often been supposed to be the paths trod by the departed, who require
      sustenance for so long a journey. The Aztecs laid a water-bottle beside
      the bodies to be used on the way to Mictlan, the land of the dead. Bow and
      arrows, a pair of mocassins with a spare piece of deerskin to patch them
      if they wear out, and sinews of deer to sew on the patches with, together
      with a kettle and provisions, are still placed in the graves by the North
      American Indians. The Laplanders lay beside the corpse flint, steel, and
      tinder, to supply light for the dark journey. A coin was placed in the
      mouth of the dead by the Greeks to pay Charon, the ferryman of the Styx,
      and for a similar purpose in the hand of a deceased Irishman. The
      Greenlanders bury with a child a dog, for they say a dog will find his way
      anywhere. In the grave of the Viking warrior were buried his horn and
      armour in order that he might enter the halls of Valhalla fully equipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      These and many other examples might be quoted showing the universality of
      the belief in a future life, a belief that was evidently shared with other
      nations by the primeval races who inhabited our islands in prehistoric
      times.
    </p>
    <p>
      The presence of food and drinking vessels in the tumuli clearly shows
      this, and also the store of weapons and implements, adzes, hammers,
      scrapers, and other tools which the barrows have preserved through so many
      ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      These barrows are not confined to one period or one race, as their shape
      denotes. Some are long, measuring 200 to 400 feet in length by 60 or 80
      feet wide; others are circular. The former were made by the long-headed
      (dolichocephalic) race of whom we have already spoken; the latter by the
      round-headed (brachycephalic), conquerors of their feebler long-skulled
      forerunners. When we consider the poor tools used by these primitive
      peoples, we may wonder at the amount of labour they must have expended on
      the construction of these giant mounds. Picks made of deer&rsquo;s horns
      and pointed staves enabled them to loosen the earth which was then
      collected in baskets and thrown on the rising heap. Countless toilers and
      many years must have been needed to produce such wonderful memorials of
      their industry.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      With better tools we will proceed to dig into these mounds and discover
      what they contain. First we notice an encircling trench and mound
      surrounding the barrow, the purpose of which is supposed to have been to
      keep the dead person in the tomb, and prevent it from injuring the living.
      After much digging in the centre of the barrow we find a single stone
      chamber, entered by a passage underneath the higher and wider end of the
      mound. Sometimes the chamber is divided into three parts, the centre one
      being covered by a dome, formed by the overlapping of the stones in the
      upper parts of the walls. The passage leading to the centre chamber is
      also built with large stones erected with much care and skill. The
      contents of these long barrows are not so interesting, or numerous, as
      those contained in the round barrows. The skeletons are usually found in
      irregular positions, and few weapons or ornaments accompany the buried
      bones. Derbyshire possesses many barrows; wherever in a place-name the
      suffix <i>low</i> occurs, derived from the Anglo-Saxon <i>hlow</i>,
      signifying a small hill or mound, a barrow is generally to be found. The
      long barrow is usually about 200 feet in length, 40 feet wide, and 8 to 12
      feet high. They run east and west, frequently north-east by south-west,
      the principal interment being usually at the eastern and higher end. The
      bodies are often found in a cist or box made of large stones, and several
      were buried in one mound, generally on the south and east sides, so that
      they might lie in the sun. This practice may have been connected with
      sun-worship; and the same idea prevailed in modern times, when the south
      side of the churchyard was considered the favoured portion, and criminals
      and suicides were relegated to the colder north side.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link040" id="link040"></a><br /> <br /><br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig">
      <img alt="040.jpg (26K)" src="images/040.jpg" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The position of the bodies varied, but usually they were buried in a
      crouching position, with knees bent and head drawn towards the knees. This
      was probably the natural position which a man would assume when he slept
      without a luxurious bed to lie upon, and with little to cover him, in
      order to keep himself as warm as possible. Hence when he sank into his
      last long sleep, his mourning relatives would place him in the same
      posture. In the Channel Islands bodies were often placed in a kneeling
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      The custom of burning the body seems to have been adopted later by the
      same long-headed race who used the long barrows, and prevailed more in the
      north of England, in Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and Scotland, than in the
      south. The cremation was sometimes not very thoroughly performed. The
      bodies were placed together, wood being piled about them, and over the
      heap the mound was raised. Then the fire was lighted, which naturally only
      partly consumed the bodies. We find also, mingled with bones of men and
      women, the bones of animals, which were probably the remains of funeral
      feasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we have said the round-headed race introduced the circular barrow, and
      cremation was their usual, though not exclusive, practice. These people
      were much stronger and bigger men than their predecessors, their powerful
      jaws and projecting chins showing much more power of will than the softer
      narrow-faced dolichocephalic race. However, in the round barrows we also
      find the bodies of the latter, and we gather that they were not
      exterminated or driven out by their conquerors, but mingled with them,
      intermarried, until at length the type of the long-skulled race prevailed,
      and the Celt of later times possessed the features of the race he had
      formerly subdued. At least such seems to be the teaching of the barrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Celt became acquainted with the use of bronze, and his tomb was
      enriched with a store of the relics of the life and art of the workmanship
      of the time. As cremation was the usual practice, it was no longer
      necessary to have a chamber which the dead might inhabit; the size of the
      sleeping-place of the dead was reduced, and a cist was constructed for the
      receptacle of the urn in which the remains were placed. The mound also was
      reduced in size and looked much less imposing than the huge barrows of the
      Stone Age; but its contents were much more important.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ashes we find frequently contained in a rude urn of black pottery with
      some ornamentation. Then we discover pins made of bones, which were
      evidently used to fasten the dress. The people therefore were evidently
      not naked, woad-dyed savages; moreover we find bits of woollen fabric and
      charred cloth, and in Denmark people belonging to this same early race
      were buried in a cap, shirt, leggings, and boots, a fairly complete
      wardrobe. They also loved to adorn themselves, and had buttons of jet, and
      stone and bone ornaments. Besides flint implements we find adzes and
      hatchets and chisels, axe-hammers constructed with a hole in them for the
      insertion of a handle, grain rubbers, wheat stones, and hammer stones. The
      mounds also disclose a great variety of flint implements, hatchets,
      scrapers, both round and long, knife-daggers, knives, saws, drills,
      fabricators or flaking tools, sling stones, hammer stones, polishers,
      arrow-points, either leaf-shaped, triangular, or barbed, and heads of
      darts and javelins. A very curious object is sometimes found, a stone
      wrist guard, for the purpose of protecting the wrist from the bow string.
    </p>
    <p>
      These barrows and their contents bear evidences to the artistic
      workmanship of the prehistoric dwellers in our villages. Their tombs show
      that these people did not confine themselves to the fabrication of objects
      of utility, but that they loved to adorn themselves with personal
      ornaments, which required much art and skill in the manufacture. Necklaces
      of beads pleased their fancy, and these they made of jet, or shells, the
      teeth of deer, and the vertebrae of fish. Moreover they loved ear-rings,
      which were sometimes made of the teeth of pigs. Objects of gold, bronze,
      glass, ivory, amber, clay, and bone were also used as ornaments.
    </p>

    </p>
    <div class="fig">
      <img alt="043.jpg (53K)" src="images/043.jpg" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      If we examine the pottery in the barrows we find that a vessel of
      earthenware was usually placed at the back of the head of the body when it
      was not cremated. There were also cinerary urns, cups, usually called
      incense cups, which were certainly not used for incense, whatever may have
      been their purpose, food and drinking vessels. This pottery was not
      sun-dried, but burnt in a fire, though not made in a kiln, and the form of
      the vessels shows that the makers were ignorant of the use of a potter&rsquo;s
      wheel. The ornamentation consisted of a series of straight lines made by a
      sharp-pointed instrument and by impressions of the finger nails or string,
      often revealing much skill and artistic workmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a study of the barrows we may learn much about the early inhabitants
      of our island, who lived and worked and died on the same spots where we
      now are spending our days. We can see them hunting in the wild woodlands,
      rearing cows and sheep and goats, and cultivating their crops of corn. We
      can still trace on the hillsides some curious terraces fashioned by them
      for the growing of their grain, and discover querns, or hand millstones,
      and stones for bruising the corn. The bones of young oxen a few days old,
      discovered in the mounds, show that they knew the use of milk, and how to
      get a good supply. A rude spindle-whorl shows that they knew how to weave
      stuffs for their clothing, and the numerous buttons, fasteners, and belts
      prove that the clothes were fitted to the wearer, and not mere shapeless
      sacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The barrows also bear evidence to the existence of some organised
      condition of society. In the early savage state of human existence the
      family is the only community; but as man progressed towards civilisation,
      he learnt how to combine with his fellows for mutual defence and support.
      We gather from our examination of the tombs of these early races that they
      had attained to this degree of progress. There were chiefs of tribes and
      families who were buried with more honour than that bestowed upon the
      humbler folk. Many families were buried in one mound, showing that the
      tribal state had been reached, while the many humbler graves denote the
      condition of servitude and dependence in which a large number of the race
      lived. All this, and much more, may be learnt from a careful study of the
      tombs of these prehistoric people.

    </p>
    <p>
      We have examined in our last chapter the abodes of the dead; we will now
      investigate the abodes of the living which the earth has preserved for us
      for so many centuries. The age of the cave dwellers had long passed; and
      the prehistoric folk, having attained to some degree of civilisation,
      began to devise for themselves some secure retreats from inclement rains
      and cold winds. Perhaps the burrowing rabbit gave them an idea for
      providing some dwelling-place. At any rate the earliest and simplest
      notion for constructing a habitation was that of digging holes in the
      ground and roofing them over with a light thatch. Hence we have the pit
      dwellings of our rude forefathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many examples of pit dwellings have been found by industrious explorers.
      Some labourers when digging gravel at Brighthampton, near Oxford, came
      across several such excavations. They were simply pits dug in the earth,
      large enough to hold one or two persons, and from the sides of these pits
      a certain quantity of earth had been removed so as to form a seat. At the
      bottom of these a few rude flint arrow-heads were found. In the remarkable
      British oppidum at Worlebury, near Weston-super-Mare, several circular,
      well-like pits may be seen, fairly preserved in shape owing to the rocky
      nature of the ground in which they have been excavated. One in particular
      is very perfect, and about two feet from the bottom is a seat formed of
      the rock extending all round the pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      These ancient pit dwellings are usually surrounded by an earthen rampart.
      Caesar says that &ldquo;the Britons called that a town where they used to
      assemble for the sake of avoiding an incursion of enemies, when they had
      fortified the entangled woods with a rampart and ditch.&rdquo; The remains
      of many of these oppida may still be seen in almost all parts of the
      country; and in most of these hollows are plainly distinguishable, which
      doubtless were pit dwellings; but owing to the sides having fallen in,
      they have now the appearance of natural hollows in the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Hurstbourne, Hants, nine of these early habitations were discovered by
      the late Dr. Stevens, some of which were rudely pitched with flint stones,
      and had passages leading into the pit. A few flints irregularly placed
      together with wood ashes showed the position of the hearths, where cooking
      operations had been carried on. The sloping entrance-passages are peculiar
      and almost unique in England, though several have been met with in France.
      A rude ladder was the usual mode of entrance into these underground
      dwellings. Fragments of hand-made British pottery and the commoner kinds
      of Romano-British ware were found, and portions of mealing stones and also
      a saddle-quern, or grain-crusher, which instruments for hand-mealing must
      have been in common use among the pit dwellers. The grain was probably
      prepared by parching it before crushing; the hollow understone prevented
      the grain from escaping; and the muller was so shaped as to render it
      easily grasped, while it was pushed backwards and forwards by the hands.
      Similar stones are used at the present time by the African natives, as
      travellers testify.

      One of the pits at Hurstbourne was evidently a cooking-hole, where the pit
      dwellers prepared their feasts, and bones of the Celtic ox (<i>bos
      longifrons</i>), pig, red deer, goat, dog, and hare or rabbit were found
      near it. One of the bones had evidently been bitten by teeth. The pit
      dwellers also practised some domestic industries, as Dr. Stevens found a
      needle, an awl or bodkin, and fragments of pointed bone, probably used for
      sewing skins together. A rude spindle-whorl shows that they knew something
      of weaving, and two bored stones were evidently buttons or
      dress-fasteners. A large supply of flint implements, scrapers, and
      arrow-heads, proves that the dwellings were inhabited by the Neolithic
      people before the Britons came to occupy them. I must not omit to notice
      the heating stones, or &ldquo;pot-boilers.&rdquo; These were heated in the
      fire, and then placed among the meat intended to be cooked, in a hole in
      the ground which served the purpose of a cooking pot. I have found many
      such stones in Berkshire, notably from the neighbourhood of Wallingford
      and Long Wittenham. The writer of the <i>Early History of Mankind</i>
      states that the Assineboins, or stone-boilers, dig a hole in the ground,
      take a piece of raw hide, and press it down to the sides of the hole, and
      fill it with water; this is called a &ldquo;paunch-kettle&rdquo;; then
      they make a number of stones red-hot in a fire close by, the meat is put
      into the water, and the hot stones dropped in until it is cooked. The
      South Sea Islanders have similar primitive methods of cooking. The
      Highlanders used to prepare the feasts of their clans in much the same
      way; and the modern gipsies adopt a not very dissimilar mode of cooking
      their stolen fowls and hedgehogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can now people these cheerless primitive pit dwellings with their
      ancient inhabitants, and understand something of their manners of life and
      customs. Their rude abodes had probably cone-shaped roofs made of rafters
      lashed together at the centre, protected by an outside coat of peat, sods
      of turf, or rushes. The spindle-whorl is evidence that they could spin
      thread; the mealing stones show that they knew how to cultivate corn; and
      the bones of the animals found in their dwellings testify to the fact that
      they were not in the wild state of primitive hunters, but possessed herds
      of cows and goats and other domestic animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who were these people? Mr. Boyd Dawkins is of opinion that the early pit
      dwellers belonged to the Neolithic folk of whom I have already told you,
      as the flint implements testify. But these dwellings were evidently
      occupied by a later people. The querns and spindle-whorl probably belonged
      to the Celts, or Britons, before the advent of the Roman legions; and that
      these people were the inhabitants of the Hampshire pit dwellings is proved
      by the presence of a British gold coin which is recognised by numismatists
      as an imitation of the Greek stater of Philip II. of Macedon. According to
      Sir John Evans, the native British coinage was in existence as early as
      150 years before Christ. Hence to this period we may assign the date of
      the existence of these Celtic primitive habitations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pit dwellings were not the only kind of habitations which the early
      inhabitants of our country used, and some of our villages possess
      constructions of remarkable interest, which recent industrious digging has
      disclosed. These are none other than lake dwellings, similar to those
      first discovered in Switzerland about fifty years ago. Few of our villages
      can boast of such relics of antiquity. Near Glastonbury, in 1892, in a
      dried-up ancient mere a lake village was discovered, which I will describe
      presently; and recently at Hedsor in Buckinghamshire a pile dwelling has
      been found which some learned antiquaries are now examining. In Ireland
      and Scotland there are found the remains of fortified dwellings called
      Crannogs in some of the lakes, as in Dowalton Loch, Wigtownshire, and
      Cloonfinlough in Connaught, but these belong to later times and were used
      in the Middle Ages.

      In primitive times, when tribe warred with tribe, and every man&rsquo;s
      hand was against his fellow-man, and when wild and savage beasts roamed o&rsquo;er
      moor and woodland, security was the one thing most desired by the early
      inhabitants of Europe. Hence they conceived the brilliant notion of
      constructing dwellings built on piles in the midst of lakes or rivers,
      where they might live in peace and safety, and secure themselves from the
      sudden attack of their enemies, or the ravages of beasts of prey.
      Switzerland is famous for its numerous clusters, or villages, of ancient
      lake dwellings, which were of considerable size. At Morges, on the Lake of
      Geneva, the settlement of huts extends 1,200 feet long by 150 in breadth;
      and that at Sutz on the Lake of Bienne covers six acres, and is connected
      with the shore by a gangway 100 feet long and 40 feet wide. Nor is the use
      of these habitations entirely abandoned at the present time. Venezuela,
      which means &ldquo;little Venice,&rdquo; derives its name from the Indian
      village composed of pile dwellings on the shores of the Gulf of Maracaibo,
      as its original explorer Alonzo de Ojeda in 1499 chose to compare the
      sea-protected huts with the queen city of the Adriatic; and in many parts
      of South America, in the estuaries of the Orinoco and Amazon, such
      dwellings are still found, also among the Dyaks of Borneo, in the Caroline
      Islands, and on the Gold Coast of Africa. Herodotus describes similar
      dwellings on the Lake Prasias, existing in the fifth century B.C., and
      Lord Avebury states that now the Roumelian fishermen on the same lake
      &ldquo;inhabit wooden cottages built over the water as in the time of
      Herodotus.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These habitations of primitive man were built on piles driven into the bed
      of the lake or river. These piles were stems, or trunks of trees,
      sharpened with stone or bronze tools. A rude platform was erected on these
      piles, and on this a wooden hut constructed with walls of wattle and daub,
      and thatched with reeds or rushes. A bridge built on piles connected the
      lake village with the shore whither the dwellers used to go to cultivate
      their wheat, barley, and flax, and feed their kine and sheep and goats.
      They made canoes out of hollow trunks of trees. One of these canoes which
      have been discovered is 43 feet in length and over 4 feet wide. The beams
      supporting the platform, on which the huts were erected, were fastened by
      wooden pins. Much ingenuity was exercised in the making of these
      dwellings. Sometimes they found that the mud of the lake was too soft to
      hold the piles; so they fashioned a framework of trunks of trees, which
      they let down to the bottom of the lake, and fastened the upright piles to
      it. Sometimes the rocky bed of the lake prevented the piles from being
      driven into it; so they heaped stones around the piles, and thus made them
      secure. The lake dwellers were very sociable, and had only one common
      platform for all the huts, which were clustered together. As all the
      actual dwellings have been destroyed by time&rsquo;s rude action, it is
      impossible to describe them accurately; but their usual size was about 20
      feet by 12 feet. The floor was of clay, and in the centre of the building
      there was a hearth made of slabs of stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people who inhabited these structures belonged either to the later
      Stone Age, or the Bronze Age, as we learn from the relics which their huts
      disclose. In the earlier ones are found celts, flint flakes, arrow-heads,
      harpoons of stag&rsquo;s horn with barbs, awls, needles, chisels, and
      fish-hooks made of bone, and sometimes wooden combs, and skates made out
      of the leg-bone of a horse. Besides the remains of the usual domestic
      animals we find bones of the beaver, bear, elk, and bison.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the use of bronze was discovered the people still lived on in their
      lake dwellings. Fire often played havoc with the wooden wattle walls;
      hence we frequently find a succession of platforms. The first dwelling
      having been destroyed by flames, a second one was subsequently
      constructed; and this having shared the same fate, another platform with
      improved huts was raised upon the ruins of its predecessors. The relics of
      each habitation show that, as time went on, the pit dwellers advanced in
      civilisation, and increased the comforts and conveniences of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the dwellings of these early peoples belong to the Bronze Age, as
      do those of the Auvernier settlement in the Lake of Neuchatel; and these
      huts are rich in the relics of their former inhabitants. At Marin on the
      same lake the lake dwellers were evidently workers in iron; and the
      relics, which contain large spear-heads, shields, horse furniture,
      fibulas, and other ornaments, together with Roman coins, prove that they
      belonged to the period of which history tells us.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have described at length these Swiss lake dwellings, although they do
      not belong to the antiquities of our villages in England, because much the
      same kind of habitations existed in our country, though few have as yet
      been unearthed. Possibly under the peaty soil of some ancient river-bed,
      or old mere, long ago drained, you may be fortunate enough to meet with
      the remains of similar structures here in England. At Glastonbury a few
      years ago a lake village was discovered, which has created no small stir
      in the antiquarian world, and merits a brief description. Nothing was
      known of its existence previously; and this is an instance of the
      delightful surprises which explorers have in store for them, when they
      ransack the buried treasure-house of the earth, and reveal the relics
      which have been so long stored there.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that met the eyes of the diggers was a series of circular low mounds,
      about sixty in number, extending over an area of three acres. Imagine the
      delight of the gentlemen when they discovered that each of these mounds
      contained the remains of a lake dwelling which was constructed more than
      two thousand years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      First they found above the soft peat, the remains of a lake long dried up,
      a platform formed of timber and brushwood, somewhat similar to the
      structures which we have seen in the Swiss lakes. Rows of small piles
      support this platform, and on it a floor of clay, or rather several
      floors. The clay is composed of several horizontal layers with intervening
      thin layers of decayed wood and charcoal, each layer representing a
      distinct floor of a dwelling. In the centre of each mound are the remains
      of rude hearths. The dwellings, of which no walls remain, were evidently
      built of timber, the crevices between the wood being filled with wattle
      and daub. In one of the mounds were found several small crucibles which
      show that the inhabitants knew how to work in metals. Querns, whetstones,
      spindle whorls, fibulae, and finger-rings of bronze, a horse&rsquo;s bit,
      a small saw, numerous implements of horn and bone, combs, needles, a jet
      ring and amber bead, all tell the tale of the degree of civilisation
      attained by these early folk. They worked in metals, made pottery and
      cloth, tilled and farmed the adjoining lands, and probably belonged to the
      late Celtic race before the advent of the Romans. These lake dwellers used
      a canoe in order to reach the mainland, and this primitive boat has been
      discovered. It is evidently cut out of the stem of an oak, is
      flat-bottomed, and its dimensions are 17 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 1
      foot deep. The prow is pointed, and has a hole, through which doubtless a
      rope was passed, in order to fasten it to the little harbour of the lake
      village.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be gathered that these people, whether dwelling in their pit or
      lake villages, showed so much capacity, industry, and social organisation,
      that even in the Neolithic Age they were far removed from a savage state,
      and a low condition of culture and civilisation. They showed great
      ingenuity in the making of their tools, their vessels of pottery, their
      ornaments, and clothing. They were not naked, woad-dyed savages. They
      could spin and weave, grow corn, and make bread, and had brought into
      subjection for their use domestic animals, horses and cattle, sheep and
      goats, and swine. They lived in security and comfort, and were industrious
      and intelligent; and it is interesting to record, from the relics which
      the earth has preserved of their civilisation, the kind of life which they
      must have lived in the ages which existed before the dawn of history.

    <p>
      Among the antiquities which some of our English villages possess, none are
      more curious and remarkable than the grand megalithic monuments of the
      ancient races which peopled our island. Marvellous memorials are these of
      their skill and labour. How did they contrive to erect such mighty
      monuments? How did they move such huge masses of stone? How did they raise
      with the very slender appliances at their disposal such gigantic stones?
      For what purpose did they erect them? The solution of these and many
      such-like problems we can only guess, and no one has as yet been bold
      enough to answer all the interesting questions which these rude stone
      monuments raise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Superstition has attempted to account for their existence. Just as the
      flint arrow-heads are supposed by the vulgar to be darts shot by fairies
      or witches which cause sickness and death in cattle and men, and are worn
      as amulets to ward off disease; just as the stone axes of early man are
      regarded as thunder bolts, and when boiled are esteemed as a sure cure for
      rheumatism, or a useful cattle medicine&mdash;so these stones are said to
      be the work of the devil. A friend tells me that in his childhood his
      nurse used to frighten him by saying that the devil lurked in a dolmen
      which stands near his father&rsquo;s house in Oxfordshire; and many weird
      traditions cluster round these old monuments.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link058" id="link058"></a><br /> <br /><br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig">
      <img alt="058.jpg (24K)" src="images/058.jpg" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the subterranean sepulchral chambers and cairns which we
      have already examined, there are four classes of megalithic structures.
      The first consists of single stones, called in Wales, Cornwall, and
      Brittany, <i>menhirs</i>, a name derived from the Celtic word <i>maen</i>
      or <i>men</i> signifying a stone, and <i>hir</i> meaning tall. In England
      they are known as &ldquo;hoar-stones,&rdquo; <i>hoar</i> meaning a
      boundary, inasmuch as they are frequently used in later times to mark the
      boundary of an estate, parish, or manor. There is one at Enstone,
      Oxfordshire, and at Wardington, Warwickshire. Possibly they were intended
      to mark the graves of deceased chieftains.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second class consists of lines of stones, which the French call <i>alignements</i>.
      Frequently they occur in groups of lines from two to fourteen in number,
      Carnac, in Brittany, possesses the best specimen in Europe of this curious
      arrangement of giant stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third class of megalithic monuments is the circular arrangement, such
      as we find at Avebury and Stonehenge. These are now usually called
      cromlechs, in accordance with the term used by French antiquaries, though
      formerly this name was applied in England to the dolmens, or chambered
      structures, of which we shall speak presently. According to the notions of
      the old curator of Stonehenge the mighty stones stood before the Deluge,
      and he used to point out (to his own satisfaction) signs of the action of
      water upon the stones, even showing the direction in which the Flood
      &ldquo;came rushing in.&rdquo; The Welsh bards say that they were erected
      by King Merlin, the successor of Vortigern; and Nennius states that they
      were erected in memory of four hundred nobles, who were treacherously
      slain by Hengist, when the savage Saxons came. There is no need to
      describe these grand circles of huge stones which all antiquaries have
      visited.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cromlech at Avebury covers a larger area than that of Stonehenge, the
      circle being about 1,300 feet in diameter. There is a fine circle at
      Rollright, in Oxfordshire, which is the third largest in England. The
      diameter of the circle is about 107 feet, and the stones numbered
      originally about sixty. Near the circle stand the Five Whispering Knights,
      five large stones leaning together, probably the remains of a dolmen, and
      a large solitary stone, or menhir. Popular tradition has woven a strange
      legend about these curious relics of bygone ages. A mighty chieftain once
      ruled over the surrounding country; but he was ambitious, and wished to
      extend his sway, and become King of England. So he mustered his army, and
      the oracle proclaimed that if he could once see Long Compton, he would
      obtain his desire. Having proceeded as far as Rollright, he was repeating
      the words of the oracle&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;If Long Compton I can see,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;King of
      England I shall be&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      when Mother Shipton, who had doubtless ridden on her broomstick from her
      Norfolk home, appeared and pronounced the fatal spell&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Move no more; stand fast, stone;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;King
      of England thou shall none.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link060" id="link060"></a><br /> <br /><br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig">
      <img alt="060.jpg (102K)" src="images/060.jpg" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately the king and his army were changed into stone, as if the head
      of Medusa had gazed upon them. The solitary stone, still called the King
      Stone, is the ambitious monarch; the circle is his army; and the Five
      Whispering Knights are five of his chieftains, who were hatching a plot
      against him when the magic spell was uttered. The farmers around Rollright
      say that if the stones are removed from the spot, they will never rest,
      but make mischief till they are restored. Stanton Drew, in Somersetshire,
      has a cromlech, and there are several in Scotland, the Channel Islands,
      and Brittany. Some sacrilegious persons transported a cromlech bodily from
      the Channel Islands, and set it up at Park Place, Henley-on-Thames. Such
      an act of antiquarian barbarism happily has few imitators.
    </p>
    <p>
      For what purpose were these massive stones erected at the cost of such
      infinite labour? Tradition and popular belief associate them with the
      Druids. Some years ago all mysterious antiquarian problems were solved by
      reference to the Druids. But these priests of ancient days are now out of
      fashion, and it is certainly not very safe to attribute the founding of
      the great stone circles to their agency. The Druidical worship paid its
      homage to the powers of Nature, to the nymphs and genii of the woods and
      streams, whereas the great stone circles were evidently constructed by
      sun-worshippers. There is no doubt among antiquaries that they are
      connected with the burial of the dead. Small barrows have been found in
      the centre of them. Dr. Anderson is of opinion that the stone circles were
      developed out of the hedge, or setting of stone, which frequently
      surrounds the base of a barrow, and was intended to keep the ghost in, and
      prevent it from injuring the living. By degrees the wall was increased in
      size while the barrow or cairn decreased; until at last a small mound of
      earth, or heap of stones, only marked the place of burial, and the huge
      circle of stones surrounded it. Stonehenge, with its well-wrought stones
      and gigantic trilitha, is much later than the circles of Avebury and
      Rollright, and was doubtless constructed by the people who used iron,
      about two hundred years before our era. The earlier circles have been
      assigned to a period eight or ten centuries before Christ.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Many conjectures have been made as to how the huge capstones of the circle
      at Stonehenge were placed on the erect stones. Sir Henry Dryden thought
      that when the upright stones were set on end, earth or small stones were
      piled around them until a large inclined plane was formed, on which
      &ldquo;skids&rdquo; or sliding-pieces were placed. Then the caps were
      placed on rollers, and hauled up by gangs of men. Probably in some such
      way these wonderful monuments were formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last class of rude stone monuments is composed of dolmens, or
      chambered tombs, so named from the Welsh word <i>dol</i>, a table, and <i>maen</i>
      or <i>men</i>, a stone. They are in fact stone tables. Antiquaries of
      former days, and the unlearned folk of to-day, call them &ldquo;Druids&rsquo;
      altars,&rdquo; and say that sacrifices were offered upon them. The typical
      form is a structure of four or more large upright stones, supporting a
      large flat stone, as a roof. Sometimes they are covered with earth or
      stones, sometimes entirely uncovered. Some antiquaries maintain that they
      were always uncovered, as we see them now; others assert that they have
      been stripped by the action of wind and rain, and snow, frost, and thaw,
      until all the earth placed around them has been removed. Possibly fashions
      changed then as now; and it may console some of us that there was no
      uniformity of ritual even in prehistoric Britain. Dolmens contain no
      bronze or iron implements, or carvings of the same, and evidently belong
      to the time of the Neolithic folk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among prehistoric remains none are more striking than the great camps and
      earthworks, which hold commanding positions on our hills and downs, and
      have survived during the countless years which have elapsed since their
      construction. Caesar&rsquo;s camps abound throughout England; it is
      needless to say that they had nothing to do with Caesar, but were made
      long years before the Conqueror ever set foot on British land. These early
      camps are usually circular in shape, or follow the natural curve of the
      hill on which they stand. Roman camps are nearly always square or
      rectangular. They consist of a high vallum, or rampart of earth,
      surrounded by a deep ditch, and on the <i>counterscarp</i>, or outside
      edge of the ditch, there is often another bank or rampart. The entrance to
      these strongholds was often ingeniously contrived, in order that an enemy
      endeavouring to attack the fortress might be effectually resisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chun Castle, in Cornwall, is an interesting specimen of ancient Celtic
      fortress. It consists of two circular walls separated by a terrace. The
      walls are built of rough masses of granite, some 5 or 6 feet long. The
      outer wall is protected by a ditch. Part of the wall is still about 10
      feet high. Great skill and military knowledge are displayed in the plan of
      the entrance, which is 6 feet wide in the narrowest part, and 16 in the
      widest, where the walls diverge and are rounded off on either side. The
      space within the fortress is about 175 feet in diameter. The Herefordshire
      Beacon on the Malvern Hills is a fine example of a triple-ramparted Celtic
      camp.

      In Berkshire we have the well-known Whittenham Clumps, the Sinodun of the
      Celts, on the summit of which there is a famous camp, with a triple line
      of entrenchment, the mound and ditch being complete. The circumference of
      the fortress is over a mile. Berkshire and Oxfordshire are very rich in
      these camps and earthworks, which guard the course of the old British road
      called the Iknield Way. Hill-forts crown the tops of the hills; and the
      camps of Blewberry, Scutchamore Knob (a corruption of Cwichelm&rsquo;s
      law), Letcombe, Uffington, and Liddington, command the ancient trackway
      and bid defiance to approaching foes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The object of these camps was to provide places of refuge, whither the
      tribe could retire when threatened by the advent of its enemy. The Celts
      were a pastoral people; and their flocks grazed on the downs and
      hillsides. When their scouts brought news of the approach of a hostile
      force, some signal would be given by the blowing of a horn, and the people
      would at once flee to their fortress driving their cattle before them, and
      awaiting there the advent of their foes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Uffington there is a remarkable relic of British times called the
      Blowing Stone, or King Alfred&rsquo;s Bugle-horn, which was doubtless used
      by the Celtic tribes for signalling purposes; and when its deep low note
      was heard on the hillside the tribe would rush to the protecting shelter
      of Uffington Castle. There, armed with missiles, they were ready to hurl
      them at the invading hosts, and protect their lives and cattle until all
      danger was past. Those who are skilled at the art can still make the
      Blowing Stone sound. The name, King Alfred&rsquo;s Bugle-horn, is a
      misnomer, and arose from the association of the White Horse Hill with the
      battle which Alfred fought against the Danes at Aescendune, which may, or
      may not, have taken place near the old British camp at Uffington. There
      are several White Horses cut out in the turf on the hillsides in
      Wiltshire, besides the famous Berkshire one at Uffington, celebrated by
      Mr. Thomas Hughes in his <i>Scouring of the White Horse</i>. We have also
      some turf-cut crosses at White-leaf and Bledlow, in Buckinghamshire. The
      origin of these turf monuments is still a matter of controversy. It is
      possible that they may be Saxon, and may be the records of Alfred&rsquo;s
      victories; but antiquaries are inclined to assign them to an earlier date,
      and connect them with the builders of cromlechs and dolmens. It is
      certainly improbable that, when he was busily engaged fighting the Danes,
      Alfred and his men would have found time to construct this huge White
      Horse.

      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the earthen mounds and deep ditch, which usually formed the
      fortifications of these ancient strongholds, there were wicker-work
      stockades, or palisading, arranged on the top of the vallum. Such defences
      have been found at Uffington; and during the present year on the ancient
      fortifications of the old Calleva Atrebatum, afterwards the Roman
      Silchester, a friend of the writer has found the remains of similar
      wattle-work stockades. Evidently tribal wars and jealousies were not
      unknown in Celtic times, and the people knew how to protect themselves
      from their foes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another important class of earthen ramparts are the long lines of
      fortifications, which extend for miles across the country, and must have
      entailed vast labour in their construction. These ramparts were doubtless
      tribal boundaries, or fortifications used by one tribe against another.
      There is the Roman rig, which, as Mrs. Armitage tells us in her <i>Key to
      English Antiquities</i>, coasts the face of the hills all the way from
      Sheffield to Mexborough, a distance of eleven miles. A Grims-dike (or
      Grims-bank, as it is popularly called) runs across the southern extremity
      of Oxfordshire from Henley to Mongewell, ten miles in length; and near it,
      and parallel to it, there is a Medlers-bank, another earthen rampart,
      exceeding it in length by nearly a third. Near Salisbury there is also a
      Grims-dike, and in Cambridgeshire and Cheshire. Danes&rsquo; Dike, near
      Flamborough Head, Wans-dike, and Brokerley Dike are other famous lines of
      fortifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are twenty-two Grims-dikes in England. The name was probably derived
      from Grim, the Saxon devil, or evil spirit; and was bestowed upon these
      mysterious monuments of an ancient race which the Saxons found in various
      parts of their conquered country. Unable to account for the existence of
      these vast mounds and fortresses, they attributed them to satanic agency.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is much work still to be done in exploring these relics of the
      prehistoric races; and if there should be any such in your own
      neighbourhood, some careful digging might produce valuable results.
      Perhaps something which you may find may throw light upon some disputed or
      unexplained question, which has perplexed the minds of antiquaries for
      some time. I do not imagine that the following legend will deter you from
      your search. It is gravely stated that years ago an avaricious person dug
      into a tumulus for some treasure which it was supposed to contain. At
      length after much labour he came to an immense chest, but the lid was no
      sooner uncovered than it lifted itself up a little and out sprang an
      enormous black cat, which seated itself upon the chest, and glowed with
      eyes of passion upon the intruder. Nothing daunted, the man proceeded to
      try to move the chest, but without avail; so he fixed a strong chain to it
      and attached a powerful team of horses. But when the horses began to pull,
      the chain broke in a hundred places, and the chest of treasure disappeared
      for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some rustics assert that if you run nine times round a tumulus, and then
      put your ear against it, you will hear the fairies dancing and singing in
      the interior. Indeed it is a common superstition that good fairies lived
      in these old mounds, and a story is told of a ploughman who unfortunately
      broke his ploughshare. However he left it at the foot of a tumulus, and
      the next day, to his surprise, he found it perfectly whole. Evidently the
      good fairies had mended it during the night. But these bright little
      beings, who used to be much respected by our ancestors, have quite
      deserted our shores. They found that English people did not believe in
      them; so they left us in disgust, and have never been heard of since.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have no other Celtic remains in your neighbourhood, at least you
      have the enduring possession of the words which they have bequeathed to
      us, such as <i>coat, basket, crook, cart, kiln, pitcher, comb, ridge</i>,
      and many others, which have all been handed down to us from our British
      ancestors. Their language also lives in Wales and Brittany, in parts of
      Ireland and Scotland, and in the Isle of Man, where dwell the modern
      representatives of that ancient race, which was once so powerful, and has
      left its trace in most of the countries of Europe.

    <p>
      &ldquo;The world&rsquo;s a scene of change,&rdquo; sings Poet Cowley; but
      in spite of all the changes that have transformed our England, the coming
      and going of conquerors and invaders, the lapse of centuries, the
      ceaseless working of the ploughshare on our fields and downs, traces of
      the old Roman life in Britain have remained indelible. Our English
      villages are rich in the relics of the old Romans; and each year adds to
      our knowledge of the life they lived in the land of their adoption, and
      reveals the treasures which the earth has tenderly preserved for so many
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your village lies near the track of some Roman road, many pleasing
      surprises may be in store for you. Oftentimes labourers unexpectedly meet
      with the buried walls and beautiful tesselated pavements of an ancient
      Roman dwelling-place. A few years ago at Chedworth, near Cirencester, a
      ferret was lost, and had to be dug out of the rabbit burrow. In doing this
      some Roman <i>tesserae</i> were dug up; and when further excavations were
      made a noble Roman villa with numerous rooms, artistic pavements,
      hypocausts, baths, carvings, and many beautiful relics of Roman art were
      brought to light. Possibly you may be equally successful in your own
      village and neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have the good fortune to live near a Roman station, you will have
      the pleasing excitement of discovering Roman coins and other treasures,
      when you watch your labourers draining the land or digging wells. Everyone
      knows that the names of many of the Roman stations are &nbsp;distinguished
      by the termination <i>Chester, caster</i>, or <i>caer</i>, derived from
      the Latin <i>castra</i>, a camp; and whenever we are in the neighbourhood
      of such places, imagination pictures to us the well-drilled Roman
      legionaries who used to astonish the natives with their strange language
      and customs; and we know that there are coins and pottery, <i>tesserae</i>
      and Roman ornaments galore, stored up beneath our feet, awaiting the
      search of the persevering digger. Few are the records relating to Roman
      Britain contained in the pages of the historians, as compared with the
      evidences of roads and houses, gates and walls and towns, which the earth
      has preserved for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near your village perhaps a Roman road runs. The Romans were famous for
      their wonderful roads, which extended from camp to camp, from city to
      city, all over the country. These roads remain, and are evidences of the
      &nbsp;great engineering skill which their makers possessed. They liked
      their roads well drained, and raised high above the marshes; they liked
      them to go straight ahead, like their victorious legions, and never swerve
      to right or left for any obstacle. They cut through the hills, and filled
      up the valleys; and there were plenty of idle Britons about, who could be
      forced to do the work. They called their roads <i>strata</i> or streets;
      and all names of places containing the word <i>street</i>, such as <i>Streatley</i>,
      or <i>Stretford</i>, denote that they were situated on one of these Roman
      roads.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may see these roads wending their way straight as a die, over hill and
      dale, staying not for marsh or swamp. Along the ridge of hills they go, as
      does the High Street on the Westmoreland hills, where a few inches below
      the grass you can find the stony way; or on the moors between Redmire and
      Stanedge, in Yorkshire, the large paving stones, of which the road was
      made, in many parts still remain. In central places, as at Blackrod, in
      Lancashire, the roads extend like spokes from the centre of a wheel,
      although nearly eighteen hundred years have elapsed since their
      construction. The name of Devizes, Wilts, is a corruption of the Latin
      word <i>divisae</i>, which marks the spot where the old Roman road from
      London to Bath was <i>divided</i> by the boundary line between the Roman
      and the Celtic districts.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to acquire a knowledge of the great roads of the Romans we must
      study the <i>Itinerary</i> of Antoninus, written by an officer of the
      imperial Court about 150 A.D. This valuable road-book tells us the names
      of the towns and stations, the distances, halting-places, and other
      particulars. Ptolemy&rsquo;s <i>Geographia</i> also affords help in
      understanding the details of the <i>Itinerary</i>, and many of the roads
      have been very satisfactorily traced. The Romans made use of the ancient
      British ways, whenever they found them suitable for their purpose. The
      British roads resembled the trackways on Salisbury Plain, wide grass
      rides, neither raised nor paved, and not always straight, but winding
      along the sides of the hills which lie in their course. There were seven
      chief British ways: Watling Street, which was the great north road,
      starting from Richborough on the coast of Kent, passing through Canterbury
      and Rochester it crossed the Thames near London, and went on through
      Verulam, Dunstable, and Towcester, Wellington, and Wroxeter, and thence
      into Wales to Tommen-y-Mawr, where it divided into two branches. One ran
      by Beth Gellert to Caernarvon and Holy Head, and the other through the
      mountains to the Manai banks and thence to Chester, Northwich, Manchester,
      Ilkley, until it finally ended in Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second great British road was the way of the Iceni, or Iknield Street,
      proceeding from Great Yarmouth, running through Cambridgeshire,
      Bedfordshire, Bucks, and Oxon, to Old Sarum, and finishing its course at
      Land&rsquo;s End. We have in Berkshire a branch of this road called the
      Ridgeway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ryknield Street beginning at the mouth of the Tyne ran through
      Chester-le-Street, followed the course of the Watling Street to Catterick,
      thence through Birmingham, Tewkesbury, and Gloucester, to Caermarthen and
      St. David&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ermyn Street led from the coast of Sussex to the south-east part of
      Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Akeman Street ran between the Iknield and Ryknield Streets, and led
      from what the Saxons called East Anglia, through Bedford, Newport Pagnel,
      and Buckingham to Alcester and Cirencester, across the Severn, and ending
      at St. David&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Upper Saltway was the communication between the sea-coast of
      Lincolnshire and the salt mines at Droitwich; and the Lower Saltway led
      from Droitwich, then, as now, a great centre of the salt trade, to the
      sea-coast of Hampshire. Traces of another great road to the north are
      found, which seems to have run through the western parts of England
      extending from Devon to Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the old British roads which existed when the Romans came. The
      conquerors made use of these ways, wherever they found them useful,
      trenching them, paving them, and making them fit for military purposes.
      They constructed many new ones which would require a volume for their full
      elucidation. Many of them are still in use, wonderful records of the
      engineering skill of their makers, and oftentimes beneath the surface of
      some grassy ride a few inches below the turf you may find the hard
      concreted road laid down by the Romans nearly eighteen hundred years ago.
      Roman milestones we sometimes find. There is one near Silchester, commonly
      called the Imp Stone, probably from the first three letters of the Latin
      word <i>Imperator</i>, carved upon it. Curious legends often cluster round
      these relics of ancient times. Just as the superstitious Saxons, when they
      saw the great Roman roads, made by a people who had long vanished from the
      land, often attributed these great works to evil spirits, and called parts
      of these well-made streets the Devil&rsquo;s Highway, so they invented a
      strange legend to account for the Imp Stone, and said that some giant had
      thrown it from the city, and left on it the marks of his finger and thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our English villages contain many examples of Roman buildings. Where now
      rustics pursue their calling, and sow their crops and reap their harvests,
      formerly stood the beautiful houses of the Roman nobles, or the
      flourishing towns of Roman citizens. Upon the sites of most of these
      old-world places new towns have been constructed; hence it is difficult
      often to trace the foundations of Roman cities in the midst of the masses
      of modern bricks and mortar. Hence we fly to the villages; and sometimes,
      as at Silchester, near a little English village, we find the remains of a
      large, important, and flourishing town, where the earth has kept safely
      for us during many centuries the treasures and memories of a bygone age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every student of Roman Britain must visit Silchester, and examine the
      collections preserved in the Reading Museum, which have been amassed by
      the antiquaries who have for several years been excavating the ruins. The
      city contained a forum, or marketplace, having on one side a basilica, or
      municipal hall, in which prisoners were tried, business transactions
      executed, and the general affairs of the city carried on. On the other
      side of the square were the shops, where the butchers, bakers, or
      fishmongers plied their trade. You can find plenty of oyster shells, the
      contents of which furnished many a feast to the Romans who lived there
      seventeen hundred years ago. The objects which have been found tell us how
      the dwellers in the old city employed themselves, and how skilful they
      were in craftsmanship. Amongst other things we find axes, chisels, files
      for setting saws, hammers, a large plane, and other carpenters&rsquo;
      tools; an anvil, a pair of tongs, and blacksmiths&rsquo; implements;
      shoemakers&rsquo; anvils, very similar to those used in our day, a large
      gridiron, a standing lamp, safety-pins, such as ladies use now, and many
      other useful and necessary objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to protect the city it was surrounded by high walls, which seem
      to defy all the attacks of time. They are nine feet in thickness, and are
      still in many places twenty feet high. Outside the wall a wide ditch added
      to the strength of the fortifications. Watch-towers were placed at
      intervals along the walls; and on the north, south, east, and west sides
      were strongly fortified gates, with guard chambers on each side, and
      arched entrances through which the Roman chariots were driven.
    </p>
    <p>
      These walls inclose a space of irregular shape, and were built on the site
      of old British fortifications. Silchester was originally a British
      stronghold, and was called by them Calleva. The Celtic tribe which
      inhabited the northern parts of Hampshire was the Atrebates, who after a
      great many fights were subdued by the Romans about 78 A.D. Then within the
      rude fortifications of Calleva arose the city of Silchester, with its fine
      houses, temples, and baths, its strong walls, and gates, and streets, the
      great centre of civilisation, and the chief city of that part of the
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is often possible to detect the course of Roman streets where now the
      golden corn is growing. On the surface of the roads where the ground is
      thin, the corn is scanty. Observation of this kind a few years ago led to
      the discovery of a Romano-British village at Long Whittenham, in Berks. In
      Silchester it is quite easy to trace the course of the streets by the
      thinness of the corn, as Leland observed as long ago as 1536. One is
      inclined to wonder where all the earth comes from, which buries old
      buildings and hides them so carefully; but any student of natural history,
      who has read Darwin&rsquo;s book on <i>Worms</i>, will cease to be
      astonished. It is chiefly through the action of these useful creatures
      that soil accumulates so greatly on the sites of ancient buildings.

      Within the walls of Silchester were gardens and villas replete with all
      the contrivances of Roman luxury. The houses were built on three sides of
      a square court. A cloister ran round the court, supported by pillars. The
      open space was used as a garden. At the back of the house were the
      kitchens and apartments for the slaves and domestics. The Romans adapted
      their dwellings to the climate in which they lived. In the sunny south, at
      Pompeii, the houses were more open, and would be little suited to our more
      rigorous climate. They knew how to make themselves comfortable, built
      rooms well protected from the weather, and heated with hypocausts. These
      were furnaces made beneath the house, which generated hot air; and this
      was admitted into the rooms by earthenware flue-tiles. The dwellers had
      both summer and winter apartments; and when the cold weather arrived the
      hypocaust furnaces were lighted, and the family adjourned to their winter
      quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The floors were made of <i>tesserae</i>, or small cubes of different
      materials and various colours, which were arranged in beautiful patterns.
      Some of these pavements were of most elegant and elaborate designs, having
      figures in them representing the seasons, or some mythological characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The walls were painted with decorations of very beautiful designs,
      representing the cornfields, just as the Roman artists in Italy loved to
      depict the vine in their mural paintings. The mortar used by the Romans is
      very hard and tenacious, and their bricks were small and thin, varying
      from 8 inches square to 18 inches by 12, and were about 2 inches in
      thickness. Frequently we find the impression of an animal&rsquo;s foot on
      these bricks and tiles, formed when they were in a soft state before they
      were baked, and one tile recently found had the impression of a Roman baby&rsquo;s
      foot. Roman bricks have often been used by subsequent builders, and are
      found built up in the masonry of much later periods.

      It is quite possible to build up in imagination the old Roman city, and to
      depict before our mind&rsquo;s eye the scenes that once took place where
      now the rustics toil and till the ground. We enter the forum, the great
      centre of the city, the common resort and lounging-place of the citizens,
      who met together to discuss the latest news from Rome, to transact their
      business, and exchange gossip. On the west side stood the noble basilica,
      or hall of justice&mdash;a splendid building, its entrance being adorned
      with fine Corinthian columns; and slabs of polished Purbeck marble, and
      even of green and white marble from the Pyrenees, covered the walls. It
      was a long rectangular hall, 233 feet in length by 58 feet in width, and
      at each side was a semicircular apse, which was called the Tribune. Here
      the magistrate sat to administer justice, or an orator stood to address
      the citizens. In the centre of the western wall was another apse, where
      the <i>curia</i> met for the government of the city. Two rows of columns
      ran down the hall, dividing it into a nave with two aisles, like many of
      our churches. Indeed the form of the construction of our churches was
      taken from these Roman basilica. Several chambers stood on the west of the
      hall, one of which was another fine hall, probably used as a corn
      exchange. The height of this noble edifice, the roof of which was probably
      hidden by a coffered ceiling, must have been about fifty-seven feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing along the main street towards the south gate we come to the
      foundations of a nearly circular temple. Two square-shaped buildings stood
      on the east of the city, which were probably temples for some Gaulish form
      of religion, as similar sacred buildings have been discovered in France. A
      quadrangle of buildings near the south gate, having various chambers,
      contained the public baths, whither the Romans daily resorted for gossip
      and discussion as well as for bathing. There is an ingenious arrangement
      for using the waste water for the purpose of flushing the drains and
      sewers. Nor were they ignorant of the invention of a force-pump, as the
      accompanying illustration on the next page shows.

      The amphitheatre stands outside the gate, whither the citizens flocked to
      see gladiatorial displays or contests between wild beasts. With the
      exception of one at Dorchester, it is the largest in Britain. It is made
      of lofty banks of earth, which surround the arena, and must have been an
      imposing structure in the days of its glory, with its tiers of seats
      rising above the level arena. It is difficult to imagine this
      grass-covered slope occupied by a gay crowd of Romans and wondering
      Britons, all eagerly witnessing some fierce fight of man with man, or
      beast with beast, and enthusiastically revelling in the sanguinary sport.
      The modern rustics, who have no knowledge of what was the original purpose
      of &ldquo;the Mount,&rdquo; as they name the amphitheatre, still call the
      arena &ldquo;the lions&rsquo; den.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Silchester was a very busy place. There were dye works there, as the
      excavations show; hence there must have been some weaving, and therefore a
      large resident population. Throngs of travellers used to pass through it,
      and carts and baggage animals bore through its streets the merchandise
      from London, which passed to the cities and villas so plentifully
      scattered in western Britain.
    </p>
    <p>
      By far the most important of the discoveries made in Roman Britain is the
      little church which stood just outside the forum. It is very similar in
      form to the early churches in Italy and other parts of the Roman Empire,
      and is of the basilican type. The orientation is different from that used
      after the reign of Constantine, the altar being at the west end. The
      churches of S. Peter and S. Paul at Rome had the same arrangement; and the
      priest evidently stood behind the altar facing the congregation and
      looking towards the east at the time of the celebration of the Holy
      Communion. There is an apse at the west end, and the building is divided
      by two rows of columns into a nave and two aisles. The nave had probably
      an ambon, or reading-desk, and was mainly used by the clergy, the aisles
      being for the use of the men and women separately. A vestry stood at the
      western end of the north aisle. Across the eastern end was the narthex, or
      porch, where the catechumens stood and watched the service through the
      three open doors. Outside the narthex was the atrium, an open court,
      having in the centre the remains of the labrum, or laver, where the people
      washed their hands and faces before entering the church. We are reminded
      of a sermon by S. Chrysostom, who upbraided his congregation, asking them
      what was the use of their washing their hands if they did not at the same
      time cleanse their hearts by repentance. This interesting memorial of
      early Christianity was probably erected soon after the Emperor Constantine&rsquo;s
      Edict of Toleration issued in 313 A.D.
    </p>
    <p>
      But not only at Silchester and at other places, once the great centres of
      the Roman population, do we find Roman remains. In addition to the
      stations, camps, and towns, there were the villas of the rich Roman
      citizens or Gaulish merchants on the sunny slopes of many a hillside.
      Although hundreds of the remains of these noble houses have been
      discovered, there are still many to be explored.
    </p>
    <p>
      The villa consisted of the house of the proprietor, which occupied the
      centre of the little colony, together with the smaller houses of the
      servants and slaves, stables, cowsheds, mills, and granaries, and all the
      other usual outbuildings connected with a large estate. The main house was
      built around a central court, like an Oxford college; and resembled in
      architectural style the buildings which the excavations at Pompeii have
      disclosed. A corridor ran round the court supported by pillars, from which
      the rooms opened. In a well-defended town like Silchester the houses were
      usually built on three sides of the court; but the country villas, which
      had occasionally to be fortified against the attacks of wandering bands of
      outlaws and wild Britons, and the inroads of savage beasts, were usually
      built on all the four sides of the square court. They were usually of one
      story, although the existence of a force-pump in Silchester shows that
      water was laid on upstairs in one house at least. As the wells were less
      than thirty feet deep, a force-pump would not be needed to lift the water
      to the earth-level. Hence in some houses there must have been some upper
      chambers, a conclusion that is supported by the thickness of the
      foundations, which are far more substantial than would be required for
      houses of one story. The rooms were very numerous, often as many as sixty
      or seventy, and very bright they must have looked decorated with beautiful
      marbles and stuccoes of gorgeous hues, and magnificent pavements, statues
      and shrines, baths and fountains, and the many other objects of Roman
      luxury and comfort. The floors were made of <i>opus signinum</i>, such as
      the Italians use at the present day, a material composed of cement in
      which are embedded fragments of stone or brick, the whole being rubbed
      down to a smooth surface, or paved with mosaic composed of <i>tesserae</i>.
      In whatever land the Roman dwelt, there he made his beautiful tesselated
      pavement, rich with graceful designs and ever-enduring colours,
      representing the stories of the gods, the poetry of nature, and the
      legends of the heroes of his beloved native land. Here we see Perseus
      freeing Andromeda, Medusa&rsquo;s locks, Bacchus and his band of
      revellers, Orpheus with his lyre, by which he is attracting a monkey, a
      fox, a peacock, and other animals, Apollo singing to his lyre, Venus being
      loved by Mars, Neptune with his trident, attended by hosts of seamen. The
      seasons form an accustomed group, &ldquo;Winter&rdquo; being represented,
      as at Brading, by a female figure, closely wrapped, holding a lifeless
      bough and a dead bird. Satyrs and fauns, flowers, Graces and wood-nymphs,
      horns of plenty, gladiators fighting, one with a trident, the other with a
      net&mdash;all these and countless other fanciful representations look at
      us from these old Roman pavements. The Roman villa at Brading is an
      excellent type of such a dwelling, with its magnificent suites of rooms,
      colonnades, halls, and splendid mosaic pavements. As at Silchester, we see
      there fine examples of hypocausts. The floor of the room, called a <i>suspensura</i>,
      is supported by fifty-four small pillars made of tiles. Another good
      example of a similar floor exists at Cirencester, and many more at
      Silchester.

      Here is a description of a Roman gentleman&rsquo;s house, as drawn by the
      writer of <i>The History of Oxfordshire</i>:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His villa lay sheltered from wild winds partly by the rising brow
      of the hill, and partly by belts of trees; it was turned towards the
      south, and caught the full sun. In the spring the breath of his violet
      beds would be as soft and sweet as in Oxfordshire woods to-day; in the
      summer his quadrangle would be gay with calthae, and his colonnade
      festooned with roses and helichryse. If we are to believe in the <i>triclinium
      aestivum</i> of Hakewill, it says much for the warmth of those far-away
      summers that he was driven to build a summer dining-room with a north
      aspect, and without heating flues. And when the long nights fell, and
      winter cold set in, the slaves heaped higher the charcoal fires in the <i>praefurnium</i>;
      the master sat in rooms far better warmed than Oxford country houses now,
      or sunned himself at midday in the sheltered quadrangle, taking his
      exercise in the warm side of the colonnade among his gay stuccoes and
      fluted columns. Could we for a moment raise the veil, we should probably
      find that the country life of 400 A.D. in Oxfordshire was not so very
      dissimilar to that of to-day, ... and that the well-to-do Roman of rustic
      Middle England was ... a useful, peaceful, and a happy person.&rdquo;

    </p>
    <p>
      The scene changes. The Roman legions have left our shores, and are trying
      to prop the tottering state of the falling empire. The groans of the
      Britons have fallen on listless or distracted ears, and no one has come to
      their succour. The rule of the all-swaying Roman power has passed away,
      and the Saxon hordes have poured over the hills and vales of rural
      Britain, and made it the Angles&rsquo; land&mdash;our England.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coming of the Saxons was a very gradual movement. They did not attack
      our shores in large armies on one or two occasions; they came in clans or
      families. The head of the clan built a ship, and taking with him his
      family and relations, founded a settlement in wild Britain, or wherever
      the winds happened to carry them. They were very fierce and relentless in
      war, and committed terrible ravages on the helpless Britons, sparing
      neither men, women, nor children, burning buildings, destroying and
      conquering wherever they went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bede tells the story of doings of the ruthless Saxons:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The barbarous conquerors ... plundered all the neighbouring cities
      and country, spread the conflagration from the eastern to the western sea
      without any opposition, and covered almost every part of the devoted
      island. Public as well as private structures were overturned; the priests
      were everywhere slain before the altars; the prelates and the people,
      without any respect of persons, were destroyed with fire and sword; nor
      was there any to bury those who had been thus cruelly slaughtered. Some of
      the miserable remainder, being taken in the mountains, were butchered in
      heaps. Others, spent with hunger, came forth and submitted themselves to
      the enemy for food, being destined to undergo perpetual servitude, if they
      were not killed even upon the spot. Some, with sorrowful hearts, fled
      beyond the seas; others, continuing in their own country, led a miserable
      life among the woods, rocks, and mountains, with scarcely enough food to
      support life, and expecting every moment to be their last.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Many antiquaries believe that the extirpation of the Britons was not so
      complete as Bede asserts, and that a large number of them remained in
      England in a condition of servitude. At any rate, the almost entire
      extinction of the language, except as regards the names of a few rivers
      and mountains, and of a few household words, seems to point to a fairly
      complete expulsion of the Britons rather than to a mingling of them with
      the conquering race.
    </p>
    <p>
      What remains have we in our English villages of our Saxon forefathers, the
      makers of England? In the first place we notice that many of the names of
      our villages retain the memory of their founders. When the family, or
      group of families, formed their settlements, they avoided the buildings
      and walled towns, relics of Roman civilisation, made clearings for
      themselves in the primeval forests, and established themselves in village
      communities. In the names of places the suffix <i>ing</i>, meaning <i>sons
      of</i>, denotes that the village was first occupied by the clan of some
      chief, whose name is compounded with this syllable <i>ing</i>. Thus the
      Uffingas, the children of Offa, formed a settlement at Uffinggaston, or
      Uffington; the Redingas, or sons of Rede, settled at Reading; the Billings
      at Billinge and Billingham; the Wokings or Hocings, sons of Hoc, at Woking
      and Wokingham. The Billings and Wokings first settled at Billinge and
      Woking; and then like bees they swarmed, and started another hive of
      industry at Billingham and Wokingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      These family settlements, revealed to us by the patronymic <i>ing</i>, are
      very numerous. At Ardington, in Berkshire, the Ardings, the royal race of
      the Vandals, settled; the Frankish Walsings at Wolsingham; the Halsings at
      Helsington; the Brentings at Brentingley; the Danish Scyldings at
      Skelding; the Thurings at Thorington; and many other examples might be
      quoted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many Saxon names of places end in <i>field</i>, which denotes a forest
      clearing, or <i>feld</i>, made by the axes of the settlers in the primeval
      woods, where the trees were <i>felled</i>. These villages were rudely
      fortified, or inclosed by a hedge, wall, or palisade, denoted by the
      suffix <i>ton</i>, derived from the Anglo-Saxon <i>tynan</i>, to hedge;
      and all names ending with this syllable point to the existence of a Saxon
      settlement hedged in and protected from all intruders. Thus we have
      Barton, Preston, Bolton, and many others. The terminations <i>yard</i>, <i>stoke</i>,
      or stockaded place, as in Basingstoke, <i>worth</i> (Anglo-Saxon <i>weorthig</i>),
      as in Kenilworth, Tamworth, Walworth, have much the same meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the most common of all the terminations of names denoting the
      presence of Anglo-Saxon settlers is the suffix <i>ham</i>. When the <i>a</i>
      is pronounced short the syllable denotes an inclosure, like <i>stoke</i>
      or <i>ton</i>; but when the <i>a</i> is long, it means home, and expresses
      the reverence with which the Anglo-Saxon regarded his own dwelling.
      England is the land of homes, and the natural affection with which we
      Englishmen regard our homes is to a great extent peculiar to our race. The
      Frenchman, the Spaniard, the Italian, do not have the same respect for
      home. Our Saxon forefathers were a very home-loving people, and it is from
      them doubtless that we inherit our love for our homes.
    </p>
    <p>
      We find, then, the Saxon holding the lands. The clan formed settlements;
      sections of each clan formed branch settlements; and several members of
      each section cut their way through the thick forests, felled the trees,
      built homesteads, where they tilled the land and reared their cattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      In early Saxon times the settlement consisted of a number of families
      holding a district, and the land was regularly divided into three
      portions. There was the village itself, in which the people lived in
      houses built of wood or rude stonework. Around the village were a few
      small inclosures, or grass yards, for rearing calves and baiting farm
      stock; this was the common farmstead. Around this was the arable land,
      where the villagers grew their corn and other vegetables; and around this
      lay the common meadows, or pasture land, held by the whole community, so
      that each family could turn their cattle into it, subject to the
      regulations of an officer elected by the people, whose duty it was to see
      that no one trespassed on the rights of his neighbour, or turned too many
      cattle into the common pasture.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link091" id="link091"></a><br /> <br /><br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig">
      <img alt="091.jpg (34K)" src="images/091.jpg" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Around the whole colony lay the woods and uncultivated land, which was
      left in its natural wild state, where the people cut their timber and
      fuel, and pastured their pigs in the glades of the forest. The cultivated
      land was divided into three large fields, in which the rotation of crops
      was strictly enforced, each field lying fallow once in three years. To
      each freeman was assigned his own family lot, which was cultivated by the
      members of his household. But he was obliged to sow the same crop as his
      neighbour, and compelled by law to allow his lot to lie fallow with the
      rest every third year. The remains of this common-field system are still
      evident in many parts of the country, the fields being termed &ldquo;lot
      meadows,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lammas lands.&rdquo; Our commons, too, many of
      which remain in spite of numerous inclosures, are evidences of the
      communal life of our village forefathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long the Saxon villages remained free democratic institutions, we do
      not know. Gradually a change came over them, and we find the manorial
      system in vogue. Manors existed in England long before the Normans came,
      although &ldquo;manor&rdquo; is a Norman word; and in the time of Canute
      the system was in full force. The existence of a manor implies a lord of
      the manor, who exercised authority over all the villagers, owned the home
      farm, and had certain rights over the rest of the land. How all this came
      about, we scarcely know. Owing to the Danish invasions, when the rude
      barbarous warriors carried fire and sword into many a peaceful town and
      village, the villagers found themselves at the mercy of these savage
      hordes. Probably they sought the protection of some thane, or <i>eorl</i>,
      with his band of warriors, who could save their lands from pillage. In
      return for their services they acknowledged him as the lord of their
      village, and gave him rent, which was paid either in the produce of these
      fields or by the work of their hands. Thus the lords of the manor became
      the masters of the villagers, although they too were governed by law, and
      were obliged to respect the rights of their tenants and servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saxon society was divided into two main divisions, the <i>eorl</i> and the
      <i>ceorl</i>, the men of noble birth, and those of ignoble origin. The
      chief man in the village was the manorial lord, a <i>thane</i>, who had
      his demesne land, and his <i>gafol</i> land, or <i>geneat</i> land, which
      was land held in villeinage, and cultivated by <i>geneats</i>, or persons
      holding by service. These villein tenants were in two classes, the <i>geburs</i>,
      or villeins proper, who held the yardlands, and the <i>cottiers</i>, who
      had smaller holdings. Beneath these two classes there were the <i>theows</i>,
      or slaves, made up partly of the conquered Britons, partly of captives
      taken in war, and partly of freemen who had been condemned to this penalty
      for their crimes, or had incurred it by poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were degrees of rank among Saxon gentlemen, as among those of
      to-day. The thanes were divided into three classes: (i.) those of royal
      rank (<i>thani regis</i>), who served the king in Court or in the
      management of State affairs; (ii.) <i>thani mediocres</i>, who held the
      title by inheritance, and corresponded to the lords of the manor in the
      later times; (iii.) <i>thani minores</i>, or inferior thanes, to which
      rank <i>ceorls</i> or merchants could attain by the acquisition of
      sufficient landed property.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can picture to ourselves the ordinary village life which existed in
      Saxon times. The thane&rsquo;s house stood in the centre of the village,
      not a very lordly structure, and very unlike the stately Norman castles
      which were erected in later times. It was commonly built of wood, which
      the neighbouring forests supplied in plenty, and had stone or mud
      foundations. The house consisted of an irregular group of low buildings,
      almost all of one story. In the centre of the group was the hall, with
      doors opening into the court. On one side stood the kitchen; on the other
      the chapel when the thane became a Christian and required the services of
      the Church for himself and his household. Numerous other rooms with
      lean-to roofs were joined on to the hall, and a tower for purposes of
      defence in case of an attack. Stables and barns were scattered about
      outside the house, and with the cattle and horses lived the grooms and
      herdsmen, while villeins and <i>cottiers</i> dwelt in the humble, low,
      shedlike buildings, which clustered round the Saxon thane&rsquo;s
      dwelling-place. An illustration of such a house appears in an ancient
      illumination preserved in the Harleian MSS., No. 603. The lord and lady of
      the house are represented as engaged in almsgiving; the lady is thus
      earning her true title, that of &ldquo;loaf-giver,&rdquo; from which her
      name &ldquo;lady&rdquo; is derived.

      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The interior of the hall was the common living-room for both men and
      women, who slept on the reed-strewn floor, the ladies&rsquo;
      sleeping-place being separated from the men&rsquo;s by the arras. The
      walls were hung with tapestry, woven by the skilled fingers of the ladies
      of the household. A peat or log fire burned in the centre of the hall, and
      the smoke hid the ceiling and finally found its way out through a hole in
      the roof. Arms and armour hung on the walls, and the seats consisted of
      benches called &ldquo;mead-settles,&rdquo; arranged along the sides of the
      hall, where the Saxon chiefs sat drinking their favourite beverage, mead,
      or sweetened beer, out of the horns presented to them by the waiting
      damsels. When the hour for dinner approached, rude tables were laid on
      trestles, and forthwith groaned beneath the weight of joints of meat and
      fat capons which the Saxon loved dearly. The door of the hall was usually
      open, and thither came the bards and gleemen, who used to delight the
      company with their songs and stories of the gallant deeds of their
      ancestors, the weird legends of their gods Woden and Thor, their Viking
      lays and Norse sagas, and the acrobats and dancers astonished them with
      their strange postures.

      Next to the thane ranked the <i>geburs</i>, who held land granted to them
      by the thane for their own use, sometimes as much as one hundred and
      twenty acres, and were required to work for the lord on the home farm two
      or three days a week, or pay rent for their holdings. This payment
      consisted of the produce of the land. They were also obliged to provide
      one or more oxen for the manorial plough team, which consisted of eight
      oxen.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was also a strong independent body of men called <i>socmen</i>, who
      were none other than our English yeomen. They were free tenants, who have
      by their independence stamped with peculiar features both our constitution
      and our national character. Their good name remains; English yeomen have
      done good service to their country, and let us hope that they will long
      continue to exist amongst us, in spite of the changed condition of English
      agriculture and the prolonged depression in farming affairs, which has
      tried them severely.

    <p>
      Besides the <i>geburs</i> and <i>socmen</i> there were the <i>cottiers</i>,
      who had small allotments of about five acres, kept no oxen, and were
      required to work for the thane some days in each week. Below them were the
      <i>theows</i>, serfs, or slaves, who could be bought and sold in the
      market, and were compelled to work on the lord&rsquo;s farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Listen to the sad lament of one of this class, recorded in a dialogue of
      AElfric of the tenth century:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sayest thou, ploughman? How dost thou do thy work?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my lord, hard do I work. I go out at daybreak, driving the oxen
      to field, and I yoke them to the plough. Nor is it ever so hard winter
      that I dare loiter at home, for fear of my lord, but the oxen yoked, and
      the ploughshare and the coulter fastened to the plough, every day must I
      plough a full acre, or more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hast thou any comrade?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a boy driving the oxen with an iron goad, who also is hoarse
      with cold and shouting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What more dost thou in the day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Verily then I do more. I must fill the bin of the oxen with hay,
      and water them, and carry out the dung. Ha! Ha! hard work it is, hard work
      it is! because <i>I am not free.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently the ploughman&rsquo;s want of freedom was his great hardship;
      his work in ploughing, feeding, and watering his cattle, and in cleansing
      their stable, was not harder than that of an ordinary carter in the
      present day; but servitude galled his spirit, and made the work
      intolerable. Let us hope that his lord was a kind-hearted man, and gave
      him some cattle for his own, as well as some land to cultivate, and then
      he would not feel the work so hard, or the winter so cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frequently men were thus released from slavery; sometimes also freemen
      sold themselves into slavery under the pressure of extreme want. A man so
      reduced was required to lay aside his sword and lance, the symbols of the
      free, and to take up the bill and the goad, the implements of slavery, to
      fall on his knees and place his head, in token of submission, under the
      hands of his master.

      Each trade was represented in the village community. There were the <i>faber</i>,
      or smith, and the carpenter, who repaired the ironwork and woodwork of the
      ploughs and other agricultural implements, and in return for their work
      had small holdings among the tenants free from ordinary services. There
      was the <i>punder</i>, or pound-man, who looked after the repair of the
      fences and impounded stray cattle; the <i>cementarius</i>, or stonemason;
      the <i>custos apium</i>, or bee-keeper, an important person, as much honey
      was needed to make the sweetened ale, or mead, which the villagers and
      their chiefs loved to imbibe; and the steward, or <i>prepositus</i>, who
      acted on behalf of the lord, looked after the interests of the tenants,
      and took care that they rendered their legal services. The surnames Smith,
      Baker, Butcher, Carter, and many others, preserve the remembrance of the
      various trades which were carried on in every village, and of the complete
      self-dependence of the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have inherited many customs and institutions from our Saxon
      forefathers, which connect our own age with theirs. In recent years we
      have established parish councils in our villages. Formerly the pet theory
      of politicians was centralisation; everything had to be done at one
      centre, at one central office, and London became the head and centre of
      all government. But recently politicians thought that they had discovered
      a new plan for carrying on the internal affairs of the country, and the
      idea was to leave each district to manage its own affairs. This is only a
      return to the original Saxon plan. In every village there was a moot-hill,
      or sacred tree, where the freemen met to make their own laws and arrange
      their agricultural affairs. Here disputes were settled, plough lands and
      meadow lands shared in due lot among the villagers, and everything
      arranged according to the custom of the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our county maps show that the shires are divided into hundreds. This we
      have inherited from our Saxon forefathers. In order to protect themselves
      from their neighbours, the Saxon colonists arranged themselves in hundreds
      of warriors. This little army was composed of picked champions, the
      representatives of a hundred families; men who were ready in case of war
      to uphold the honour of their house, and to fight for their hearths and
      homes. These hundred families recognised a bond of union with each other
      and a common inheritance, and ranged themselves under one name for general
      purposes, whether for defence, administration of justice, or other
      objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a fixed day, three times a year, in some place where they were
      accustomed to assemble&mdash;under a particular tree,[<a href="#linkb1">1</a>]
      or near some river-bank&mdash;these hundred champions used to meet their
      chieftain, and gather around him when he dismounted from his horse. He
      then placed his spear in the ground, and each warrior touched it with his
      own spear in token of their compact, and pledged himself to mutual
      support. At this assembly criminals were tried, disputes settled, bargains
      of sale concluded; and in later times many of these transactions were
      inserted in the chartularies of abbeys or the registers of bishops, which
      thus became a kind of register too sacred to be falsified. A large number
      of the hundreds bear the name of some chieftain who once used to call
      together his band of bearded, light-haired warriors and administer rude
      justice beneath a broad oak&rsquo;s shade.[<a href="#linkb2">2</a>] Others
      are named after some particular spot, some tree, or ford, or stone, or
      tumulus, where the hundred court met.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our counties or shires were not formed, as is popularly supposed, by King
      Alfred or other royal person by the dividing up of the country into
      portions, but were the areas occupied by the original Saxon tribes or
      kingdoms. Most of our counties retain to this day the boundaries which
      were originally formed by the early Saxon settlers. Some of our counties
      were old Saxon kingdoms&mdash;such as Sussex, Essex, Middlesex&mdash;the
      kingdoms of the South, East, and Middle Saxons. Surrey is the Sothe-reye,
      or south realm; Kent is the land of the Cantii, a Belgic tribe; Devon is
      the land of the Damnonii, a Celtic tribe; Cornwall, or Corn-wales, is the
      land of the Welsh of the Horn; Worcestershire is the shire of the Huiccii;
      Cumberland is the land of the Cymry; Northumberland is the land north of
      the Humber, and therefore, as its name implies, used to extend over all
      the North of England. Evidently the southern tribes and kingdoms by
      conquest reduced the size of this large county and confined it to its
      present smaller dimensions. In several cases the name of the county is
      derived from that of its chief town, <i>e.g.</i> Oxfordshire,
      Warwickshire; these were districts which were conquered by some powerful
      earl or chieftain, who held his court in the town, and called his newly
      acquired property after its name.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have seen the picture of an ordinary English village in early Saxon
      times, the villeins and slaves working in the fields and driving their
      oxen, and the thane dressed in his linen tunic and short cloak, his hose
      bandaged to the knee with strips of cloth, superintending the farming
      operations. We have seen the freemen and thanes taking an active part in
      public life, attending the courts of the hundred and shire, as well as the
      folk moot or parish council of those times, and the slave mourning over
      his lack of freedom. But many other relics of Saxon times remain, and
      these will require another chapter for their examination.

      [1] Until the eighteenth century there stood a pollard oak in the parish

      <a name="linkb2" id="linkb2"></a><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      [2] Other theories with regard to the origin of the hundred have been
      suggested. Some writers maintain that the hundred was a district whence
      the hundred warriors were derived, or a group of townships. But the Bishop
      of Oxford in his <i>Constitutional History</i> states: &ldquo;It is very
      probable that the colonists of Britain arranged themselves in hundreds of
      warriors; it is not probable that the country was carved into equal
      districts. The only conclusion that seems reasonable is that under the
      name of geographical hundreds we have the variously sized <i>pagi</i>, or
      districts, in which the hundred warriors settled, the boundaries of these
      being determined by other causes.&rdquo;

    <p>
      The earth has preserved a vast store of relics of the Saxons, and for
      these we must search in the barrows which contain their dead. There are
      certain peculiarities which characterise these memorials of the race. The
      larger tumuli, whether belonging to Celt or Roman, usually stand alone, or
      in groups of not more than two or three, and were the monuments of
      distinguished people; whereas the Saxon barrows form a regular cemetery,
      each group being the common burying-place of the people in the district.
      Another characteristic is the large number of articles which they contain.
      Moreover it was the practice of the other races to lay the body on the
      ground, and build up the chamber and mound above it. The Saxons on the
      other hand laid the body in a deep grave before they began to construct
      the barrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The body was usually stretched out on its back, but is sometimes found in
      a sitting position, as in graves recently discovered on Lord Wantage&rsquo;s
      estate, Berks. Coffins of hollowed trunks of trees were occasionally used,
      but these were not common. If the dead man was a warrior, his weapons were
      buried with him, and we find the head and spike of his spear, heads of
      javelins, a long iron broad-sword, a long knife, occasionally an axe, and
      over his breast the iron boss of his shield, the wooden part of which has
      of course decayed away.

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The articles of personal adornment are very numerous. Fibulae, or
      brooches, and buckles, made of bronze, are very beautifully ornamented.
      Gold fibulae of circular form are found in the Kentish barrows, frequently
      ornamented with real or fictitious gems. Rings, bracelets, necklaces of
      beads, pendants for the neck and ears, are very common. The beads are of
      glass, or amber, or variegated clay. Hairpins with which the Saxon ladies
      bound up their tresses, chatelaines with tweezers for removing superfluous
      hairs, toothpicks, scissors, and small knives, are very frequent, and
      combs made of bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      When cremation was used the ashes were deposited in an urn made of rude
      earthenware without the help of a lathe. Drinking-vessels of glass of fine
      and delicate workmanship, pointed or rounded at the bottom, are common.
      From the construction of these cups it is evident that the Saxon allowed
      no &ldquo;heel-taps.&rdquo; Bronze bowls, dishes, and basins are found in
      Saxon barrows, and occasionally buckets.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pair of dice was found in a grave at Kingston Down, which indicates a
      favourite pastime of the Saxons. The presence of a large number of Roman
      coins shows that they used Roman money long after the legions had left our
      shores. Sceattas, or Saxon silver coins, are also frequently discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many Saxon cemeteries have been discovered in various parts of England,
      but a vast number have never been examined; and the careful inspection of
      the contents of barrows must throw much light upon Saxon settlements in
      England. Bede tells us that there were three different branches of this
      race. The Jutes settled in Kent and the Isle of Wight. The Saxons settled
      in Essex, the country of the East Saxons, Sussex, that of the South
      Saxons, and Wessex, of the West Saxons. The Angles settled in East Anglia.
      Now an examination of barrows shows that the Angles practised cremation
      and urn burial, which was not so common amongst the Jutes and Saxons, and
      the fibulae found in the tombs of these tribes differ considerably in
      shape and size. The contents of these graves throw much light on the
      history of the people, their customs and habits. The action of the plough
      has often obliterated the traces of ancient barrows. It is advisable that
      the position of all such mounds should be carefully noted and recorded,
      and where possible excavations made which may help in settling many vexed
      questions, and enable us to understand more fully the condition of the
      pagan Saxon, ere the light of Christianity had dawned upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our names for the days of the week tell us of the gods of our Saxon
      forefathers, whom they worshipped in their pagan and unregenerate state.
      Sun-day, Moon-day, Tuisco&rsquo;s-day, Woden&rsquo;s-day, Thor&rsquo;s-day,
      Frya&rsquo;s-day, Saeter&rsquo;s-day, link us on to the times when these
      &ldquo;whelps from the kennels of barbarism,&rdquo; as the Britons loved
      to call their conquerors, swept away the old British Church, and
      established their heathen rites and customs. Their religion resembled that
      of their Scandinavian neighbours. Each village had its sacred spot, some
      clearing in the forest, a tree, or well, whither the people resorted to
      pray to their gods, and practise superstitious rites and customs which
      lingered long after the introduction of Christianity, and even still
      survive. They had also a few temples whither the freemen came three times
      a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Driven out of England the ancient British Church found a refuge in the
      wilds of Wales and Cornwall, where it lived on and flourished vigorously,
      allied to the Churches of Ireland and Scotland, sending out missionaries
      to the Continent of Europe, having schools and colleges, monasteries, and
      numerous churches. Llancarvan, in Glamorganshire, was a celebrated seat of
      learning; and all places named Bangor, such as Bangor-Iscaed, St. Asaph,
      and many others, possessed schools and colleges. The village names of
      numerous places in Wales and Cornwall record the labours of many earnest,
      saintly men, who brought Christianity to the savage folk in these wild
      regions. There are nearly five hundred names of these holy men in Wales
      alone, whose memory is retained by this simple record; and Cornwall is
      dotted over with churches dedicated to men and women whose names are
      strange, and of whom we know nothing. History tells us of some of these
      early saints and martyrs, of St. Alban, the first British martyr, who was
      slain 303 A.D. during the Diocletian persecution in the city which bears
      his name; of St. David, a Welsh prince, who followed the active life of
      John the Baptist, and preached like him. The memory of early saints is
      enshrined in the names, St. Ives, St. Neots, St. Bees, and in St. Edmund&rsquo;s
      Bury, named after St. Edmund, who was taken prisoner by Ingvar the Viking,
      and having been bound to a tree, was scourged, and served as a target for
      the arrows of the Danes, being afterwards beheaded. All these record the
      bravery and zeal of the holy men of old who loved their God, and for His
      sake feared not to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing need be said of the conversion of the English. That is a story
      which has been often told. The scene is again changed. The temples of
      Woden and Thor at Canterbury and Godmundingham and elsewhere, with their
      heathen altars and shrines and idols, have been changed into Christian
      churches, and other houses of God have been raised in the various
      kingdoms; while Paulinus, Berinus, Aidan, Winfrid, and other preachers,
      travelled through the country, exhorting the people to accept the
      Christian faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Memorials of these early Christian missionaries remain in many a village
      churchyard. Often there stands near the village church an old stone cross,
      its steps worn away by the rains and frosts of thirteen centuries; its
      head has doubtless gone, broken off by the force of the gales, or by the
      wild rage of human passion and Puritanical iconoclastic zeal; but it
      preserves the memory of the first conversion of the Saxon villagers to
      Christianity, and was erected to mark the spot where the people assembled
      to hear the new preacher, and to consecrate it for this purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the life of St. Willibald we read that it was the custom of the Saxon
      nation, on the estates of some of their nobles or great men, to erect, not
      a church, but the sign of the Holy Cross, dedicated to God, beautifully
      and honourably adorned, and exalted on high for the common use of daily
      prayer. It is recorded also that St. Kentigern used to erect a cross in
      any place where he had converted the people, and where he had been staying
      for some time. Very probably the Saxon preacher would make use of the old
      open-air meeting-place, where the pagan villagers used to worship Woden;
      and thus the spots still used for public worship are in many cases the
      same which used to echo with the songs of Thor and the prayers of pagan
      Saxons.
    </p>
    <p>
      These crosses were the rallying-points for Christian congregations before
      churches arose, and the bells in their turrets summoned the people to the
      service of God. In Somersetshire alone there are two hundred relics of the
      piety of our forefathers; and the North of England and Scotland are
      especially rich in crosses. No two are ever quite similar. Some are of
      simple design or character; but many have such beautiful carving and
      scrollwork that we are astonished at the skill of the workmen who, with
      very simple and rude tools, could produce such wonderful specimens of art.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pagan Saxons worshipped stone pillars; so in order to wean them from
      their ignorant superstition, the Christian missionaries, such as St.
      Wilfrid, erected these stone crosses, and carved upon them the figures of
      the Saviour and His Apostles, displaying before the eyes of their hearers
      the story of the cross written in stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The North of England has very many examples of the zeal of these early
      preachers of the faith, and probably most of them were fashioned by the
      monks and followers of St. Wilfrid, who was Archbishop of York at the
      beginning of the eighth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he travelled about his diocese a large body of monks and workmen
      attended him; and amongst these were the cutters in stone who made the
      crosses and erected them on the spots which Wilfrid consecrated to the
      worship of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Whalley cross is earlier than the time of Wilfrid. It is one of the
      crosses of Paulinus, who was one of the priests sent by Pope Gregory to
      help Augustine in the work of converting the Saxons, and who became
      Archbishop of York. Under the shadow of this very cross Paulinus, who came
      to England in 601 A.D., preached nearly thirteen hundred years ago. Indeed
      an old monkish writer wished to represent that Augustine himself came to
      Whalley and erected the cross, which he calls &ldquo;St. Augustine&rsquo;s
      Cross&rdquo;; but there is little doubt that Paulinus was the founder. In
      Puritan times this and other relics of early faith suffered badly, and was
      removed with two others from the churchyard, and used as a gatepost; but
      the spoiler repented, and restored it once more to its old resting-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how did the founders learn to make such beautiful patterns and
      designs? St. Wilfrid had travelled much; he had been to Rome and seen the
      wonderful examples of Roman skill in the great city. The Romans had left
      behind them in England their beautiful pavements, rich in designs, with
      splendid borders of fine workmanship. These, doubtless, the monks copied
      on parchment in the writing-rooms of their monasteries, and gave their
      drawings to the monks in the stone-shed, who reproduced them in stone. The
      only tool they had to produce all this fine and delicate work was the
      pick, and this increases our wonder at the marvels they were able to
      accomplish.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a famous cross at Ruthwell, in Dumfriesshire, which for a short
      time formed part of the kingdom of Northumbria. Scenes from early
      Christian history are portrayed, and these are surrounded by bands with
      sentences in Latin describing them. The lowest panel is too defaced for us
      to determine the subjects; on the second we see the flight into Egypt; on
      the third figures of Paul, the first hermit, and Anthony, the first monk,
      are carved; on the fourth is a representation of our Lord treading under
      foot the heads of swine; and on the highest there is the figure of John
      the Baptist with the Lamb. On the opposite side are the Annunciation, the
      Salutation, and other scenes of gospel history. On the side of the cross
      is some beautiful scrollwork, which shows a wonderful development of skill
      and art.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the Latin sentences there are five stanzas of an
      Anglo-Saxon poem of singular beauty. It is the story of the crucifixion
      told in touching words by the cross itself, which narrates its own sad
      tale from the time when it was a growing tree by the woodside, until at
      length, after the body of the Lord had been taken down&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The warriors left me there,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;Standing
      defiled with blood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the head of the cross are inscribed the words, &ldquo;Caedmon made me.&rdquo;
      This Caedmon was the holy monk, on whom the gift of writing verses was
      bestowed by Heaven, who in the year 680 A.D. began to pour forth his songs
      in praise of Almighty God, and told in Anglo-Saxon poetry the story of the
      creation and the life of our Lord. The Bewcastle cross is somewhat similar
      to that at Ruthwell. We see again the figure of our Lord standing on the
      heads of swine, but the lower figure is represented with a hawk, the sign
      of nobility, and is probably that of a person to whom the cross is a
      memorial. The ornamentation on this cross is very perfect and beautifully
      executed. The very beautiful cross at Eyam, in Derbyshire, differs both in
      style and workmanship from almost any other. The shaft has evidently been
      broken. In the panels of the head of the cross are figures of angels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes we find some very strange beasts carved on the old crosses. On
      the cross at Ilkley we observe some of these curious animals with their
      long tails interlacing. Sometimes the tail is wound round the creature&rsquo;s
      body, and the idea of the artist was to represent the animal reduced to a
      state of powerlessness. One forepaw is held up in sign of submission.
      Above is a figure of our Lord triumphing over the powers of evil, and
      these animals represent probably man&rsquo;s lower nature owning the
      supremacy of the King of Heaven. On the other side of the cross are
      figures of the four evangelists. The upper half of the figures alone
      appears dressed in flowing garments; each is carrying a book; circles of
      glory surround their heads, which are the symbols of the evangelists. St.
      Matthew has a man&rsquo;s head; St. Mark a leopard&rsquo;s; St. Luke&rsquo;s
      a calf&rsquo;s; and St. John an eagle&rsquo;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crosses at Hexham, where Archbishop Wilfrid founded a monastery, are
      very ancient. We are able to tell the date of these stones, for they were
      placed at the head and feet of the grave of Bishop Acca, who was a
      follower of St. Wilfrid, and accompanied him on his missionary journeys.
      Acca succeeded Wilfrid as Bishop of Hexham, and according to the old
      chronicler Bede, &ldquo;being a most active man and great in the sight of
      God and man, he much adorned and added to his church.&rdquo; Acca died in
      738 A.D., and as the monastery of Hexham was soon destroyed, these crosses
      must have been erected eleven hundred and sixty-three years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cross at St. Andrew&rsquo;s, Bishop Auckland, is of much later date,
      and the workmanship is not nearly so fine and delicate as in the earlier
      crosses. The Saxons had deteriorated as a race just before the Normans
      came, and although the cross still appears on the flat stone, the design
      on the shaft of the cross merely represents a hunting scene; and a Saxon
      bowman is shown shooting at some animals. The religious conceptions of an
      earlier and purer time have disappeared. The moustache of the sportsman
      also shows that the stone belonged to a period very near the Norman
      Conquest, when that fashion of wearing the hair was in vogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      England is remarkable for these specimens of ancient art. On the Continent
      there are very few of these elaborately carved crosses; but it is
      noteworthy that wherever the English or Irish missionaries went, they
      erected these memorials of their faith. In Switzerland, where they founded
      some monasteries, there are some very similar to those in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several other kinds of crosses besides those in churchyards.
      There are market crosses, called &ldquo;cheeping&rdquo; crosses after the
      Anglo-Saxon <i>cheap</i>, to buy, from which Cheapside, in London,
      Chippenham and Chipping Norton derive their names. Some crosses are
      &ldquo;pilgrim&rdquo; crosses, and were erected along the roads leading to
      shrines where pilgrimages were wont to be made, such as the shrine of St.
      Thomas a Becket at Canterbury, Glastonbury, Our Lady of Walsingham.
      Sometimes they were erected at the places where the corpse rested on its
      way to burial, as the Eleanor crosses at Waltham and Charing, in order
      that people might pray for the soul of the deceased. Monks also erected
      crosses to mark the boundaries of the property of their monastery.

      <br />OLD MARKET CROSS <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Time has dealt hardly with the old crosses of England. Many of them were
      destroyed by the Puritans, who by the Parliamentary decree of 1643,
      ordered that all altars and tables of stones, all crucifixes, images and
      pictures of God and the saints, with all superstitious inscriptions,
      should be obliterated and destroyed. In London, St. Paul&rsquo;s Cross,
      Charing Cross, and that in Cheapside, were levelled with the ground, and
      throughout the country many a beautiful work of art which had existed
      hundreds of years shared the same fate. Place-names sometimes preserve
      their memory, such as Gerard&rsquo;s Cross, in Buckinghamshire, Crosby,
      Crossens, Cross Inn, Croston; these and many others record the existence
      in ancient times of a cross, and probably beneath its shade the first
      preachers of the gospel stood, when they turned the hearts of our heathen
      ancestors, and taught them the holy lessons of the Cross.

      Early English style&mdash;Decorated style&mdash;Perpendicular style.
    </p>
    <p>
      The early Saxon clergy lived in monasteries, where they had a church and a
      school for the education of the sons of thanes. Monastic houses, centres
      of piety and evangelistic zeal, sprang up, the abodes of religion,
      civilisation, peace, and learning. They were the schools of culture,
      sacred and profane, of industry and agriculture; the monks were the
      architects, the painters, the sculptors, the goldsmiths of their time.
      They formed the first libraries; they taught the young; they educated
      women in convents, and by degrees dispersed the shades of ignorance,
      idolatry, and barbarism, and reformed England.
    </p>
    <p>
      To record the number of these monastic houses which were erected in the
      seventh and eighth centuries would require much space; and as our chief
      concern is with the vestiges that remain in our English villages, and as
      most of these Saxon monasteries were plundered and destroyed by the Danes,
      or rebuilt on a grander scale by the Normans, we will not now enumerate
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the country had been evangelised by the itinerant monks and
      preachers, the next process was to establish a church in every village,
      and to provide a pastor to minister therein. Archbishop Theodore
      encouraged the thanes to build and endow churches on their estates, and
      introduced to this country the parochial system, by means of which all
      villages could have the services of a resident pastor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the thane&rsquo;s house was not considered complete without its
      chapel; and in the scattered hamlets and village communities churches
      arose, rudely built of wood and roofed with thatch, wherein the Saxon <i>ceorls</i>
      and <i>cottiers</i> loved to worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great Churchmen of the day were not content with such humble
      structures. They had travelled to Rome, and seen there some of the fine
      buildings dedicated for divine service; so they determined to have the
      like in their own country. One of these noble builders was Benedict
      Biscop, founder of the twin monasteries of Wearmouth and Jarrow. When he
      built the former, he imported foreign artists from Gaul, who constructed
      the monastery after the Roman style, and amongst other things introduced
      glazed windows, which had never been seen in England before. Nor was his
      new house bare and unadorned. He brought from Rome vast stores of church
      furniture, many books, and the &ldquo;arch-chanter&rdquo; John, to teach
      his monks the music and ritual of Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aldhelm, Abbot of Malmesbury, and first Bishop of Sherborne, was one of
      the foremost church-builders of the time, and the beautiful churches at
      Malmesbury, Sherborne, Bradford-on-Avon, Frome, and Wareham, owe their
      erection to his instrumentality. Wilfrid also was one of the saintly
      architects of the period. Here is a description of the church of St.
      Andrew, at Hexham, taken from the writings of Richard, prior of the
      monastery there:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The foundations of this church St. Wilfrid laid deep in the earth
      for the crypts and oratories, and the passages leading to them, which were
      then with great exactness contrived and built under ground. The walls,
      which were of great length, and raised to an immense height, and divided
      into three several stones or tiers, he supported by square and other kinds
      of well-polished columns. Also, the walls, the capitals of the columns
      which supported them, and the arch of the sanctuary, he decorated with
      historical representations, imagery, and various figures of relief, carved
      in stone, and painted with a most agreeable variety of colour. The body of
      the church he compassed about with pentices and porticoes, which, both
      above and below, he divided with great and inexpressible art, by partition
      walls and winding stairs. Within the staircases, and above them, he caused
      flights of steps and galleries of stone, and several passages leading from
      them both ascending and descending, to be so artfully disposed, that
      multitudes of people might be there, and go quite round the church,
      without being seen by anyone below in the nave. Moreover in the several
      divisions of the porticoes or aisles, he erected many most beautiful and
      private oratories of exquisite workmanship; and in them he caused to be
      placed altars in honour of the Blessed Virgin Mary, St. Michael, St. John
      the Baptist, and the holy Apostles, martyrs, confessors, and virgins, with
      all decent and proper furniture to each of them, some of which, remaining
      at this day, appear like so many turrets and fortified places.&rdquo;

    <p>
      The Danish wars had a disastrous effect on such noble structures raised by
      these monastic architects, as well as on many a rustic village church,
      which fell a prey to the ruthless invading bands of pagan warriors. But
      frequently, as we study the history written in the stonework of our
      churches, we find amid the massive Norman walls traces of the work of
      Saxon builders, an arch here, a column there, which link our own times
      with the distant past when England was divided into eight kingdoms, or
      when Danegeld was levied to buy off the marauding strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roman buildings served as a model for our Saxon architects, and Roman
      bricks were much used by them. Brixworth Church is perhaps the finest
      specimen of our early Saxon churches. It has semicircular arches, made of
      Roman bricks, springing from square massive piers with single abaci.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link120" id="link120"></a><br /> <br /><br />

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      We will try to point out the distinguishing features of Saxon work, in
      order that you may be able to detect the evidence of its existence in your
      own village and neighbourhood. The walls are chiefly formed of rubble or
      rag stone, having &ldquo;long and short work,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> long
      block of cut stone laid alternately horizontally and vertically, at the
      corners of the building and in the jambs of the doors. Often narrow ribs
      of masonry run vertically up the walls, and a string-course runs
      horizontally. The churches of Barnack and Wittering in Northamptonshire,
      St. Michael&rsquo;s, Oxford, and the towers of Earl&rsquo;s Barton are
      good examples of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link121" id="link121"></a><br /> <br /><br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig">
      <img alt="121.jpg (41K)" src="images/121.jpg" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Saxon doorways have semicircular arches, and sometimes the head is shaped
      in the form of a triangle. The jambs are square-edged, the stone of the
      arch is plain, and a hood or arch of ribwork projecting from the surface
      of the wall surrounds the doorway. Belfry windows have two
      semicircular-headed lights divided by a <i>baluster</i> shaft, <i>i.e.</i>
      a column resembling a turned-wood pillar. This feature is quite peculiar
      to Saxon architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anglo-Saxon single-light windows have two splays, increasing in width from
      the centre of the wall in which the window is placed. Norman windows have
      only one splay on the internal side of the building. Saxon arches
      separating the nave from the aisles and chancel are plain. There is no
      sub-arch as in Norman buildings. They are often very small, sometimes only
      five or six feet wide, and stand on square piers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link122" id="link122"></a><br /> <br /><br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig">
      <img alt="122.jpg (38K)" src="images/122.jpg" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Some Saxon churches have crypts, but few of them remain. The crypt made by
      St. Wilfrid at Hexham, mentioned above, still exists, and also one at
      Ripon Cathedral, in which there is a small window called &ldquo;Wilfrid&rsquo;s
      needle.&rdquo; There is a legend about this which states that if a maid
      goes through the &ldquo;needle,&rdquo; she will be married within the
      year. Repton Church has a very perfect specimen of Saxon crypt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ground plan of Saxon churches differed. Many were cruciform, and
      consisted of nave, transepts, and chancel. The east wall of the chancel
      was often semicircular or polygonal, sometimes rectangular. The church of
      St. Lawrence, at Bradford-on-Avon, mentioned by William of Malmesbury, is
      a fine specimen of a Saxon church, and also the little church at Escombe,
      Durham, and that of Deerhurst, Gloucestershire, recently rescued from
      being used as a farmstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the close of the thousandth year after the birth of Christ a new
      impulse was given to church-building. People imagined that with that year
      the millennium would arrive and the Second Advent take place. It would be
      vain to build beautiful churches, if they were so soon to perish in the
      general destruction of the world, as vain as to heap up treasure by means
      of trade. Hence people&rsquo;s minds were unsettled, and the churches left
      in ruins. But when the millenary had safely passed away, they began to
      restore the fallen shrines, and build new churches, and the late Saxon or
      early Norman style came into vogue. Canute was a great church-builder, and
      Edward the Confessor rebuilt Westminster Abbey after the new fashion. Then
      came William the Conqueror with his Norman builders, and soon nearly every
      village had its church, which was constructed, according to William of
      Malmesbury, <i>novo aedificandi genere</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will now notice the characteristics of early Norman work, traces of
      which you may be able to recognise in your own church. The doorways are
      very remarkable, profusely adorned with richly carved ornamental mouldings
      and sculpture. The archways are round, and are composed of a succession of
      receding arches, all elaborately carved. The doorway of Malmesbury Church
      has eight arches, recessed one within the other. These arches are
      supported by one or more shafts, which are sometimes carved. Above the
      door and below the arch is the tympanum, covered with sculpture,
      representing scriptural subjects, such as the figure of the Saviour in
      allusion to His saying, &ldquo;I am the door,&rdquo; or the <i>Agnus Dei</i>,
      or Adam and Eve, or such legendary or symbolical subjects as St. George
      and the Dragon, or the Tree of Life.

    </p>
    <p>
      Porches are not very common in early Norman structures, but several still
      exist, notably at Malmesbury, Balderton, and Brixworth. The windows are
      usually small and narrow, the jambs being splayed only on the inside of
      the church. Three such windows placed together usually give light over the
      altar. The walls of Norman buildings are thick and massive, and are often
      faced with cut stone. String-courses or mouldings projecting from the
      walls, run horizontally along them, and are often adorned with the zigzag
      or other Norman patterns of ornament. The tower often stands between the
      nave and the chancel, and is usually low and massive. In the eastern
      counties are found many round towers made of flint masonry. Flat
      buttresses are a sure sign of Norman work, as they were not used in any of
      the subsequent styles of architecture.

      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The arches of the Norman builders are easily recognised. The piers in
      country churches are nearly always cylindrical; but there are several
      examples of massive square or octagonal piers, and also a number of round
      columns attached, so as to form one pier. The <i>cushion</i> capital is
      the most common form used in the Norman style. It is easily recognisable,
      but difficult to be described; and perhaps the accompanying sketch will
      enable the reader to discover a cushion capital when he sees it. The early
      Norman builders loved to bestow much labour on their capitals; and while
      preserving the usual cushion form, enriched them with much elaboration.
      The <i>scallop</i> frequently occurs, and also the <i>volute</i>, which
      was copied from the work of Roman builders, who themselves imitated the
      Greek sculptures. Sometimes the capitals are elaborately carved with
      figures of men, or animals, or foliage.

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman arches resemble the doorways in having sub-arches recessed within
      an outer arch, the intrados often being decorated with mouldings such as
      the zigzag or the lozenge. The chancel arch is usually very elaborately
      ornamented with various mouldings, which are very numerous and peculiar.
      Those illustrated on the previous page are the most common.

    </p>
    <p>
      The Normans were also much skilled in vaulting with stone, as the crypts
      in our churches testify. Over the vaulted roof of the aisles was the <i>triforium</i>,
      a kind of gallery between this roof and the external roof of the church.
      Very few of the wooden roofs of Norman churches remain. The fonts are
      large, square or cylindrical in shape, and are decorated with mouldings or
      sculpture, often very elaborate but rudely executed. At Winchester
      Cathedral the font is carved with a representation of the baptism of King
      Cynigils at Dorchester. Other favourite subjects were the creation of man,
      the formation of Eve, the expulsion from Paradise, Christ upon the cross,
      the Four Evangelists, the baptism of our Lord, and legendary or symbolical
      representations.

    </p>
    <p>
      This style of architecture prevailed until about the middle of the twelfth
      century, when the <i>Transition Norman</i> became in vogue. It is
      characterised by the introduction of the pointed arch. Many conjectures as
      regards its origin have been made. Some suppose that the idea of making
      the arch pointed was suggested by the intersection of semicircular arches
      in ornamental arcades. Others say that the Crusaders introduced it on
      their return from the East, or that it was suggested by the Norman
      vaulting, or from the form of the <i>vesica piscis</i>, the most ancient
      of Christian symbols. The Cistercian monks were the first to introduce it
      to this country, and the Cistercian abbeys of Fountains, Kirkstall,
      Furness, and Tintern are noble specimens of Transition Norman work.
      Religious zeal and enthusiasm are often reflected in the improved
      condition of our churches, and the grand buildings of this period are
      outward and visible signs of a great religious revival. Semicircular
      arches, however, continued to be used for windows and for the triforium;
      the capitals of the piers were decorated with foliage somewhat similar to
      that used in a subsequent period.

      Then arose the Early English style of architecture which flourished from
      about the year 1175 to 1275, and is characterised by a gradual abandonment
      of the heavy and massive features of the Norman style, and the adoption of
      lighter and more elegant forms of construction and decoration. Salisbury
      Cathedral, erected 1220-1260 A.D., is the most perfect example of this
      period. The arches are pointed, and the piers supporting them are often
      composed of an insulated cylindrical column surrounded by slender detached
      shafts, all uniting together under one capital, and divided into parts by
      horizontal bands. In small churches plain octagonal or circular piers are
      frequently used, as in the succeeding style, from which they can only be
      distinguished by the mouldings. Mouldings are often the surest guides in
      helping us to ascertain the date of a building. We have already studied
      the Norman mouldings. In this style they are composed of bold rounds and
      deep hollows, usually plain, or ornamented with the dog-tooth.

      The lancet window is now introduced, at first of only one light, very
      narrow and long, and differing from the Norman window in having a pointed
      arch. At the east end of the chancel there are often three lancet windows,
      the centre one higher than the rest, with one dripstone over them. The
      first idea of window-tracery was the introduction of a plain
      lozenge-shaped opening over a double lancet window, the whole being
      covered by a single dripstone. From this simple arrangement it was not
      difficult to develop the beautiful bar-tracery which came into vogue in
      the subsequent period of English architecture. The capitals of the Early
      English style are bell-shaped, at first quite plain, but subsequently
      these are often covered with beautifully sculptured foliage of a very
      graceful character. Circular windows at this period came into vogue in the
      gables of churches. They were either plain or quatre-foiled. Norman towers
      were sometimes capped with spires in the thirteenth century. The walls are
      not so thick or massive as in the Norman period, and the buttresses are
      stouter and more numerous, and project further from the wall. Flying
      buttresses were also introduced at this period. We can generally
      distinguish Early English work from that of the Norman style by its
      lightness and elegance, as compared with the roughness and massiveness of
      the latter; and its plainness and simplicity sufficiently distinguish it
      from that of the Decorated period.

      The Decorated style (1275-1375) which prevailed during the reigns of the
      three Edwards was ushered in by a period of Transition, during which there
      was gradually developed the most perfect style which English architectural
      skill has ever attained. In the thirteenth century our builders were
      striving to attain the highest forms of graceful design and artistic
      workmanship. In the fourteenth their work reached perfection, while in the
      fifteenth there was a marked decline in their art, which in spite of its
      elaborate details lacked the beauty of the Decorated style.

    <p>
      The arches of this period are usually wider, and are distinguished from
      those of the Early English by the character of the mouldings. The
      ball-flower, consisting of a ball inclosed by three or four leaves,
      somewhat resembling a rosebud, is the favourite ornament, and a
      four-leaved flower is often used. Roll mouldings, quarter, half, or
      three-quarters round, frequently occur, and produce a very pleasing
      effect. The form of the arch is in many instances changed, and the
      graceful <i>ogee</i> arch is introduced. The piers are round or octagonal
      in village churches, and in large churches are formed by a cluster of
      cylindrical shafts, not detached as in the preceding period, but closely
      united. The capitals are bell-shaped, and in large churches richly
      sculptured. Few of the wooden roofs remain, as they have been superseded
      in later times; but the marks of the old roofs may often be seen on the
      eastern wall of the tower. The windows are larger than those of the
      earlier style, and are filled with geometrical and flowing tracery of
      great variety and beauty. Small windows have heads shaped in the ogee or
      trefoil forms. Square-headed windows are not uncommon, especially in the
      clerestory, and in monastic churches circular windows are frequently met
      with. It is characteristic of this style that the carving is not so deep
      as in the previous work. We find groups of shallow mouldings separated by
      one cut deeper than the others.

    <p>
      At length the glories of the Decorated period pass away and are merged and
      lost in the <i>Perpendicular</i> which held sway from 1375 to 1540. The
      work is now more elaborate and richer, but lacks the majestic beauty of
      the Decorated style. It is easy to distinguish Perpendicular windows. They
      are larger than any which we have seen before; the mullions are carried
      straight up through the head of the window; smaller mullions spring from
      the heads of the principal lights, and thus the windows are broken up into
      panel-like compartments, very different from the beautiful curves of the
      Decorated style. Simple pointed arches are still in use, but gradually
      they become flattened; and the arch, commonly known as the Tudor arch, is
      a peculiar feature of this style. In village churches the mouldings of the
      arch are often continued down the piers without any capital or shaft.

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Piers are commonly formed from a square or parallelogram with the angles
      fluted, having on the flat face of each side a semicyclindrical shaft. The
      base mouldings are polygonal. The most common doorway is the Tudor arch
      having a square head over it. The doors are often richly ornamented. There
      are a large number of square-headed windows, and so proud were these
      builders of their new style of window that they frequently inserted
      Perpendicular windows in walls of a much earlier date. Hence it is not
      always safe to determine the age of a church by an examination of the
      windows alone. Panel-work tracery on the upper part of the interior walls
      is a distinctive feature of this style.

    </p>
    <p>
      The slope of the roof is much lower than before, and often the former
      high-pitched roofs were at this period replaced by the almost flat roofs
      prevalent in the fifteenth century. The parapets are often embattled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rose, the badge of the houses of York and Lancaster, is often used as
      an ornamental detail, and also rows of the Tudor flower, composed of four
      petals, frequently occur. One of the most distinctive mouldings is the <i>cavetto</i>,
      a wide shallow hollow in the centre of a group of mouldings. Also we find
      a peculiar wave, and a kind of double ogee moulding which are
      characteristic of the style.

    </p>
    <p>
      Spires of this period are not very common, and usually spring from within
      the parapet. The interiors of our churches were enriched at this time with
      much elaborate decoration. Richly carved woodwork in screens, rood-lofts,
      pulpits, and pews, sculptured sedilia and a noble reredos, and much
      exuberance of decorative imagery and panel-work, adorned our churches at
      this time, much of which was obliterated or destroyed by spoliators of the
      Reformation period, the iconoclastic Puritans of the seventeenth century,
      or the &ldquo;restorers&rdquo; of the nineteenth. However, we may be
      thankful that so much remains to the present day of the work of our great
      English church-builders, while we endeavour to trace the history of each
      church written in stone, and to appreciate these relics of antiquity which
      most of our villages possess.

    <h3>
      NORMAN VILLAGES AND THE <i>DOMESDAY BOOK</i>
    </h3>

      The coming of the Normans&mdash;<i>Domesday Book</i>&mdash;Its objects&mdash;Its
      contents&mdash; Barkham in <i>Domesday</i>&mdash;Saxon families&mdash;Saxons
      who retained their estates&mdash;Despoiled landowners&mdash;Village

      of Normans&mdash;The teaching of <i>Domesday</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great stir in our English villages when the news was brought
      to them that William of Normandy had landed in England, and intended to
      fight for the English Crown. News travelled very slowly in those days.
      First the villeins and the cottiers who were not fighting with their lord
      heard that a great battle had been fought at Stamford Bridge, in
      Yorkshire, in which their gallant King Harold had defeated his own brother
      Tostig, aided by the King of Norway, Hardrada, and a large army. Then the
      news reached them that William of Normandy had arrived, and that Harold
      was marching night and day to meet him. Then they heard of the fatal
      battle of Hastings; and when it was told them that their brave King Harold
      was slain, and that William, the Norman, was the conqueror of England and
      the acknowledged king of the country, all England groaned to hear the
      fatal news. And then, after a few years, they found that their old lord
      had been deprived of his estates, and a new, haughty, proud Norman, who
      talked like a Frenchman, and laughed at their dear old Saxon language,
      came and ruled over them. He brought Norman servants with him, who took
      the best of the land, and made the Saxons do all the hard work on the
      farm, treating them like slaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now we must examine a most valuable document which throws a
      wonderfully clear light on the condition of England just before and after
      the Conquest. I refer to the <i>Domesday Book</i>, or survey of the
      country which William caused to be made. The Anglo-Saxon chronicler tells
      us that after a great Council at Gloucester the king &ldquo;sent his men
      over all England, into every shire, and caused to be ascertained how many
      hundred hides were in the shire, or what land the king himself had, and
      cattle within the land, or what dues he ought to have in twelve months
      from the shire. Also he caused to be written how much land his archbishops
      had, and his suffragan bishops, and abbots, and earls; and though I may
      narrate somewhat prolixly, what or how much each man had who was a holder
      of land in England, in land, or in cattle, and how much money it might be
      worth. So very narrowly he caused it to be traced out, that there was not
      one single hide, nor one yard of land, nor even, it is shame to tell,
      though it seemed to him no shame to do, an ox, nor a cow, nor a swine was
      left that was not set down in his writ. And all the writings were brought
      to him afterwards.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioners appointed by the king, among whom were Remigius, Bishop
      of Lincoln, and Walter Giffard, Earl of Buckingham, were to inquire the
      following details concerning each parish:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Its name. Who held it in the time of King Edward the Confessor. The
      present possessor. Number of hides in the manor, number of ploughs, of
      homagers, villeins, cottars, free tenants, tenants in socage; how much
      wood, meadow, and pasture; number of mills and fishponds; the value in the
      time of the last king; and its present value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a survey was of immense value. Its object, according to the king, was
      that every man might know and be satisfied with his rightful possessions,
      and not with impunity usurp the property of others. But it was also of
      great service to the king, so that he might know who were his vassals, the
      amount of taxation which he could draw from them, and the actual strength
      of his new kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioners performed their work with much care and exactness. The
      survey is wonderfully complete, and was compiled in a very short time. It
      is of great value to the historians of subsequent ages. The writing of the
      book is very clear and beautiful, the abbreviations alone presenting some
      difficulty to an unaccustomed reader. No illuminations adorn the text. At
      the head of each page the name of the county is written in red ink. The
      book is preserved in an ancient chest in the Public Record Office, where
      it was removed from the Chapter House at Westminster.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example we may take the <i>Domesday</i> description of the parish of
      Barkham, which runs as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;IN CERLEDONE HD.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rex ten in dnio Bercheha. AElmer Tenuit de rege. E. Te 7 m &nbsp;iii
      hid. Tra e iii car. In dnio e una, 7 vi uilli 7 iiii bord cu iii car. Ibi
      v. ac pti. Silua de XL pore. Valuit iiii lib. T.R.E. 7 m: iii. lib.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      TRANSLATION.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the hundred of Charlton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king holds Barkham in demesne. AElmer held it of King Edward.
      Then, as now, it was rated for three hides. The land is three ploughlands.
      In demesne there is one ploughland. There are six villeins, four borderers
      with three ploughs. There are five acres of pasture. Wood for the
      pasturage of forty hogs. It was worth 4l. in the time of King Edward,
      afterwards, and now, 3l.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      King Edward here mentioned was Edward the Confessor. A hide, when it is
      used as a measure of land, may be taken at about one hundred and twenty
      acres. A ploughland was as much land as one plough with oxen could plough
      in a year. The villeins were men who tilled their lord&rsquo;s land, and
      in return for certain services had holdings under him. The borderers were
      cottagers who also worked for their lord and held smaller holdings, from
      one to ten acres. In other entries we find the number of serfs recorded,
      and also mention of the hall of the lord of the manor, where the manorial
      courts were held, the church, the priest&rsquo;s house, the names of
      landowners and tenants, the mill, and of the various officers and artisans
      who made up the village community.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Domesday</i> tells us of the old Saxon families, many of whom lost
      their estates when the Conqueror came, and were supplanted by the
      favourites of the new king. Some of them contrived to weather the storm
      and retain their lands. Almer, or Almar, the lord of Barkham, who
      succeeded his brother Stigand as Bishop of Elmham in 1047, when the latter
      became archbishop, was among the number of the dispossessed, and probably
      found shelter with many of his compatriots in the cloister. Several of
      William&rsquo;s Norman adventurers married the heiresses of the old Saxon
      gentry, and thus became possessed of great estates. Thus Robert D&rsquo;Oili
      married the daughter of Wigod, lord of Wallingford, and soon gained
      possession of his father-in-law&rsquo;s property.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the names of the fortunate Saxons who retained their estates are
      few in comparison with those who were dispossessed. We find Edgar
      Atheling, real heir to the throne, retaining a small estate; but he was a
      feeble prince, and therefore not to be feared by William. His sister
      Cristina had also land in Oxfordshire. Bishop Osbern, of Exeter, a kinsman
      of the late king, also held his estates; and amongst the list we find
      Seward the huntsman, of Oxfordshire; Theodric the goldsmith; Wlwi the
      huntsman, of Surrey; Uluric the huntsman, of Hampshire, who were not
      deprived of their lands, their occupations being useful to the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      The list of despoiled landowners is a long one, and need not here be
      recorded. One Brictric was very unfortunate. When ambassador to Baldwin of
      Flanders he refused to marry the count&rsquo;s daughter Maud. The slighted
      lady became the Conqueror&rsquo;s consort, and in revenge for her despised
      love caused Brictric to be imprisoned and his estates confiscated, some of
      which were given to the queen. The luckless relations and connections of
      the late royal house were consistently despoiled, amongst them Editha, the
      beautiful queen of King Edward, and daughter of Earl Godwin, of whom it
      was written: &ldquo;<i>Sicut spina rosam genuit Godwynus Editham</i>&rdquo;;
      and Gida, the mother of Harold; Godric, his son; and Gwith, his brother.
      Harold himself&mdash;the earl, as he is called, and not the king, who
      fought and died at Senlac, if he did not, as the romance states, end his
      life as a holy hermit at Chester&mdash;had vast estates all over England,
      which went to enrich William&rsquo;s hungry followers. Hereward the Wake,
      the English hero, also held in pre-Norman days many fat manors. Few of the
      Saxon landowners were spared, and it is unnecessary here to record the
      names of the Uchtreds, Turgots, Turchils, Siwards, Leurics, who held lands
      &ldquo;in the time of King Edward,&rdquo; but whose place after Domesday
      knows them no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Domesday</i> tells us also the names of the officers and artisans who
      played important parts in the old village communities. The <i>villani</i>,
      or villeins, corresponding to the Saxon <i>ceorls</i>, were the most
      important class of tenants in villeinage, and each held about thirty acres
      in scattered acre or half-acre strips, each a furlong in length and a
      perch or two in breadth, separated by turf balks. The villein thus
      supported himself and his family, and in return was bound to render
      certain services to the lord of the manor, to work on the home farm, and
      provide two or more oxen for the manorial plough-team. He was not a free
      tenant, could acquire no property, and his lord&rsquo;s consent was needed
      for the marriage of his daughters. But the law protected him from unjust
      usage; his holdings were usually regranted to his son. He could obtain
      freedom in several ways, and by degrees acquired the rights and privileges
      of a free tenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next to the villeins were the <i>bordarii</i>, who lived in <i>bords</i>
      or cottages, <i>i.e.</i> boarded or wooden huts, and ranked as a lower
      grade of villeins. They held about five acres, but provided no oxen for
      the manorial plough-team. Below them were the <i>cottarii</i>, or
      cottiers, who were bound to do domestic work and supply the lord&rsquo;s
      table. They corresponded to the modern labourer, but lacked his freedom.
      The lowest class of all were the <i>servi</i>, or serfs, who corresponded
      to the Saxon <i>theows</i>. In Norman times their condition was greatly
      improved; they mingled with the cottiers and household servants, and
      gradually were merged with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>sochemanni</i>, or socmen, our yeomen, who abounded chiefly in the
      Danish district of England, were inferior landowners who had special
      privileges, and could not be turned out of their holdings, though they
      rendered certain services to the lord of the manor, and in this respect
      differed little from the villeins. <i>Domesday Book</i> also mentions a
      class of men called <i>burs</i> or <i>geburs</i>, who were the same as <i>coliberti</i>;
      also the <i>commendati</i>, who received privileges in return for services
      rendered to the lord of the manor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each village community was self-contained, and had its own officers.
      Although <i>Domesday Book</i> was not compiled in order to ascertain the
      condition of the Church and its ministers, and frequently the mention of a
      parish church is omitted where we know one existed, the <i>presbyter</i>,
      or priest, is often recorded. Archbishop Egbert&rsquo;s <i>Excerptiones</i>
      ordained that &ldquo;to every church shall be allotted one complete
      holding (mansa), and that this shall be free from all but ecclesiastical
      services.&rdquo; According to the Saxon laws every tenth strip of land was
      set aside for the Church, and <i>Domesday</i> shows that in many villages
      there was a priest with his portion of land set apart for his support.
    </p>

      Then there was a <i>prepositus</i>, bailiff or reeve, who collected the
      lord&rsquo;s rents, assisted by a <i>bedellus</i>, beadle or
      under-bailiff. <i>Bovarii</i>, or oxherds, looked after the plough-teams.
      The <i>carpentarius</i>, or carpenter; the <i>cementarius</i>, or
      bricklayer; the <i>custos apium</i>, or beekeeper; the <i>faber</i>, or
      smith; the <i>molinarius</i>, or miller&mdash;were all important officers
      in the Norman village; and we have mention also of the <i>piscatores</i>
      (fishermen), <i>pistores</i> (bakers), <i>porcarii</i> (swineherds), <i>viccarii</i>
      (cowmen), who were all employed in the work of the village community.

    <p>
      <i>Domesday Book</i> enables us to form a fairly complete picture of our
      villages in Norman and late Saxon times. It tells us of the various
      classes who peopled the village and farmed its fields. It gives us a
      complete list of the old Saxon gentry and of the Norman nobles and
      adventurers who seized the fair acres of the despoiled Englishmen. Many of
      them gave their names to their new possessions. The Mandevilles settled at
      Stoke, and called it Stoke-Mandeville; the Vernons at Minshall, and called
      it Minshall-Vernon. Hurst-Pierpont, Neville-Holt, Kingston-Lysle,
      Hampstead-Norris, and many other names of places compounded of Saxon and
      Norman words, record the names of William&rsquo;s followers, who received
      the reward of their services at the expense of the former Saxon owners. <i>Domesday
      Book</i> tells us how land was measured in those days, the various tenures
      and services rendered by the tenants, the condition of the towns, the
      numerous foreign monasteries which thrived on our English lands, and
      throws much light on the manners and customs of the people of this country
      at the time of its compilation. <i>Domesday Book</i> is a perfect
      storehouse of knowledge for the historian, and requires a lifetime to be
      spent for its full investigation.

    </p>
    <p>
      Many an English village can boast of the possession of the ruins of an
      ancient castle, a gaunt rectangular or circular keep or donjon, looking
      very stern and threatening even in decay, and mightily convincing of the
      power of its first occupants. The new masters did not feel very safe in
      the midst of a discontented and enraged people; so they built these huge
      fortresses with strong walls and gates and moats. Indeed before the
      Conquest the Norman knights, to whom the weak King Edward the Confessor
      granted many an English estate, brought with them the fashion of building
      castles, and many a strong square tower began to crown the fortified
      mounds. Thence they could oppress the people in many ways, and the writers
      of the time always speak of the building of castles with a kind of
      shudder. After the Conquest, especially during the regency of William&rsquo;s
      two lieutenants, Bishop Odo and Earl William Fitz-osbern, the Norman
      adventurers who were rewarded for their services by the gift of many an
      English manor, built castles everywhere. The wretched men of the land were
      cruelly oppressed by forced labour in erecting these strongholds, which
      were filled &ldquo;with devils and evil men.&rdquo; Over a thousand
      castles were built in nineteen years, and in his own castle each earl or
      lord reigned as a small king, coining his own money, making his own laws,
      having power of life and death over his dependants, and often using his
      power most violently and oppressively.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The original Norman castle consisted of a keep, &ldquo;four-square to
      every wind that blew,&rdquo; standing in a bailey court. It was a mighty
      place with walls of great thickness about one hundred and fifty feet high.
      It contained several rooms, one above the other. A deep well supplied the
      inhabitants with water. Spiral stone steps laid in the thickness of the
      wall led to the first floor where the soldiers of the garrison resided.
      Above this was the hall, with a chimney and fireplace, where the lord of
      the castle and his guests had their meals, and in the thickness of the
      wall there were numerous chambers used as sleeping-apartments and
      garderobes, and the existence of a piscina in one of these shows that it
      was a small chapel or oratory. The upper story was divided by wooden
      partitions into small sleeping-rooms; and unlike our modern houses, the
      kitchen was at the top of the keep, and opened on the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Descending some stone steps which led from the ground floor in ancient
      time we should visit the dungeons, dark, gloomy, and dreadful places,
      where deep silence reigns, only broken by the groans of despairing
      captives in the miserable cells. In one of these toads and adders were the
      companions of the captive. Another poor wretch reposed on a bed of sharp
      flints, while the torture-chamber echoed with the cries of the victims of
      mediaeval cruelty, who were hanged by their feet and smoked with foul
      smoke, or hung up by their thumbs, while burning rings were placed on
      their feet. In Peak Castle, Derbyshire, a poor, simple squire, one Godfrey
      Rowland, was confined for six days without either food or drink, and then
      released from the dungeon with his right hand cut off. In order to extract
      a heavy ransom, to obtain lands and estates, to learn the secrets of
      hidden treasure, the most ingenious and devilish tortures were inflicted
      in these terrible abodes.

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The same style of castle-building continued for a century and a half after
      the Norman Conquest. It is possible to distinguish the later keeps by the
      improved and fine-jointed ashlar stonework, by the more frequent use of
      the stone of the district, instead of that brought from Caen, by the ribs
      upon the groins of the vaulting of the galleries and chambers in the
      walls, and by the more extensive use of ornaments in the bosses, windows,
      doors, and fireplaces. The style of the decoration approaches the Early
      English character.
    </p>
    <p>
      The walls of the keep were not the only protection of the fortress. A moat
      surrounds the whole castle, crossed by a drawbridge, protected on the side
      remote from the castle by a barbican. High walls with an embattled parapet
      surround the lower court, or ballium, which we enter by a gate defended by
      strong towers. A portcullis has to be raised, and a heavy door thrown
      back, before we can enter; while above in the stone roof of the archway
      there are holes through which melted lead and pitch can be poured upon our
      heads, if we attempt to enter the castle as assailants. In the lower court
      are the stables, and the mound where the lord dispenses justice, and where
      criminals and traitors are executed. Another strong gateway flanked by
      towers protects the inner court, on the edge of which stands the keep
      which frowns down upon us as we enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      An immense household was supported in every castle. Not only were there
      men-at-arms, but also cooks and bakers, brewers and tailors, carpenters,
      smiths, masons, and all kinds of craftsmen; and all the crowd of workers
      had to be provided with accommodation by the lord of the castle. Hence a
      building, in the form of a large hall, was erected sometimes of stone,
      usually of wood, in the lower or upper court for these soldiers and
      artisans, where they slept and had their meals.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new type of castle was introduced during the reigns of the three
      Edwards. The stern, massive, and high-towering keep was abandoned, and the
      fortifications arranged in a concentric fashion. A fine hall with kitchens
      occupied the centre of the fortress; a large number of chambers was added,
      and the inner and outer courts both defended by walls, as we have already
      described, were introduced. The Edwardian castles of Caernarvon and
      Beaumaris belong to this type of fortress.

      <br />BROUGHTON CASTLE <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The border counties of Wales are remarkable for the number and beauty of
      their ancient castles. On the site of British earthworks the Romans
      established their camps. The Saxons were obliged to erect their rude
      earthen strongholds in order to keep back the rebellious Welsh, and these
      were succeeded by Norman keeps. Monmouthshire is famous for its castles;
      out of the eleven hundred erected in Norman times twenty-five were built
      in that county. There is Chepstow Castle, with its early Norman gateway
      spanned by a circular arch flanked by round towers. In the inner court
      there are the gardens and ruins of a grand hall, and in the outer the
      ruins of a chapel with evidences of beautifully groined vaulting, and also
      a winding staircase leading to the battlements. In the dungeon of the old
      keep at the south-east corner of the inner court Roger de Britolio, Earl
      of Hereford, was imprisoned for rebellion against the Conqueror, and in
      later times Henry Martin, the regicide, lingered as a prisoner for thirty
      years, employing his enforced leisure in writing a book in order to prove
      that it is not right for a man to be governed by one wife. Then there is
      Grosmont Castle, the fortified residence of the Earl of Lancaster;
      Skenfrith Castle; White Castle, the <i>Album Castrum</i> of the Latin
      records, the Landreilo of the Welsh, with its six towers, portcullis, and
      drawbridge flanked by massive tower, barbican, and other outworks; and
      Raglan Castle, with its splendid gateway, its Elizabethan banqueting-hall
      ornamented with rich stone tracery, its bowling-green, garden terraces,
      and spacious courts, an ideal place for knightly tournaments in ancient
      days. Raglan is associated with the gallant defence of the castle by the
      Marquis of Worcester in the Civil War.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ancient castles of England were the central feature of feudal society.
      They were the outward and visible sign of that system. M. Guizot in his <i>History
      of Civilisation</i> says, &ldquo;It was feudalism which constructed them;
      their elevation was, so to speak, the declaration of its triumph.&rdquo;
      On the Continent they were very numerous long before castle-building
      became the fashion in England, and every suzerain saw with displeasure his
      vassal constructing his castle; for the vassal thus insured for himself a
      powerful means of independence. The Norman barons in the troublous times
      of Stephen lived a life of hunting and pillage; they were forced to have a
      fortified retreat where they might shut themselves up after an expedition,
      repel the vengeance of their foes, and resist the authorities who
      attempted to maintain order in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Others followed the example of the barons. The townsfolk fortified their
      towns, monks their monasteries; and even within the town-walls many houses
      had their towers and gates and barriers in order to keep back troublesome
      visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a description of a French castle in the fourteenth century:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First imagine to yourself a superb position, a steep mountain,
      bristling with rocks, furrowed with ravines and precipices; upon the
      declivity is the castle. The small houses which surround it set off its
      grandeur; the river seems to turn aside with respect; it forms a large
      semicircle at its feet. This castle must be seen when, at sunrise, the
      outward galleries glimmer with the armour of the sentinels, and the towers
      are shown all brilliant with their large new gratings. Those high
      buildings must be seen, which fill those who defend them with courage, and
      with fear those who should be tempted to attack them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The door presents itself covered with heads of boars or wolves,
      flanked with turrets and crowned with a high guard-house. Enter, there are
      three inclosures, three moats, three drawbridges to pass. You find
      yourself in a large square court, where are cisterns, and on the right and
      left the stables, hen-houses, pigeon-houses, coach-houses; the cellars,
      vaults, and prisons are below; above are the dwelling-apartments; above
      these are the magazines, larders, or salting-rooms, and arsenals. All the
      roofs are bordered with machicolations, parapets, guard-walks, and
      sentry-boxes. In the middle of the court is the donjon, which contains the
      archives and the treasure. It is deeply moated all round, and can only be
      entered by a bridge, almost always raised. Although the walls, like those
      of the castle, are six feet thick, it is surrounded up to half its height
      with a chemise, or second wall, of large cut stones. This castle has just
      been rebuilt. There is something light, fresh, laughing about it, not
      possessed by the heavy massive castles of the last century.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      One would scarcely expect to hear a castle described as &ldquo;light,
      fresh, laughing&rdquo;; yet so a fourteenth-century castle seemed to eyes
      accustomed to the gloomy, stern, and massive structures of the eleventh
      and twelfth centuries. In these no beauty or display of art was attempted.
      Defence and safety were the only objects sought after in the construction
      of our ancient strongholds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange as it may seem, these castles were the birthplaces and homes of
      chivalry. Women were raised to an exalted position, and honoured and
      reverenced by knights and warriors. A prize won in a tournament was
      esteemed of vastly greater value, if it were bestowed upon the successful
      combatant by some lady&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Queens of Beauty&rdquo;
      presided at these contests of knightly skill and daring. The statutes and
      ordinances for jousts and tournaments made by John Tiptoft, Earl of
      Worcester, at the command of Edward IV., conclude thus: &ldquo;Reserving
      always to the queenes highness and the ladyes there present, the
      attributing and gift of the prize after the manner and forme accustomed.&rdquo;
      If a knight was guilty of any impropriety of conduct, he was soundly
      beaten by the other knights, in order to teach him to respect the honour
      of the ladies and the rights of chivalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the days of chivalry a knight vowed in somewhat extravagant language
      eternal love to his particular lady fair, wore her glove or her guerdon on
      his helmet, and swore to protect it with his life. Family ties and
      domestic joys were cultivated. The wife of a knight was often herself a
      warrior. Fair ladies have donned armour and followed their lords to the
      Crusades; and often during her lord&rsquo;s absence at the wars in France,
      or Scotland, or the Holy Land, the wife would defend his fief and castle,
      and sometimes was called upon to withstand a siege, when some neighbouring
      lord coveted the fair estates of the absent warrior, and sought to obtain
      them by force of arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The castles also were schools, not of learning, but of arms and chivalry,
      where the sons of vassals were trained in all the qualites that become a
      knight. The sons of vassals were sent to the castle of the suzerain to be
      brought up with his sons. Numerous reasons have been assigned for the
      origin of this custom, which we need not now enumerate. The practice,
      however, became general, and concerning it an ancient work entitled <i>L&rsquo;ordre
      de la Chevalerie</i> records:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is fitting that the son of the knight, while he is a squire,
      should know how to take care of a horse; and it is fitting that he should
      serve before and be subject to his lord; for otherwise he will not know
      the nobleness of his lordship when he shall be a knight; and to this end
      every knight shall put his son in the service of another knight, to the
      end that he may learn to carve at table and to serve, and to arm and
      apparel a knight in his youth. According as to the man who desires to
      learn to be a tailor or a carpenter, it is desirable that he should have
      for a master one who is a tailor or a carpenter; it is suitable that every
      nobleman who loves the order of chivalry, and wishes to become and be a
      good knight, should first have a knight for a master.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the young squire attained the age of manhood he was admitted to the
      honour of knighthood, which was bestowed upon him with much ceremony and
      dignity. First he was divested of his garments and put in a bath, a symbol
      of purification; then they clothed him in a white tunic, a symbol of
      purity, in a red robe, a symbol of the blood which he was bound to shed in
      the service of the faith; and then in a close black coat, a reminder of
      the death which awaited him. Then he was obliged to observe a fast for
      twenty-four hours, and in the evening entered the church and there passed
      the night in prayer. On the morrow after confession and the receiving of
      Holy Communion, he heard a sermon upon the duties of knighthood, and then
      advancing to the altar presented his sword to the priest, who blessed it.
      Kneeling before his lord he was asked, &ldquo;With what design do you
      desire to enter into the order? If it is in order to become rich, to
      repose yourself, and to be honoured without doing honour to chivalry, you
      are unworthy of it, and would be to the order of chivalry what the
      simoniacal priest is to the prelacy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His answers being satisfactory, knights, or ladies, advance and clothe him
      with the equipments of his order, spurs, the hauberk or coat of mail, the
      cuirass, the vambraces and gauntlets, and lastly his sword. Then his lord
      gives him three blows of a sword on his shoulder, saying, &ldquo;In the
      name of God, of Saint Michael, and Saint George I dub thee knight,&rdquo;
      adding, &ldquo;Be brave, adventurous, and loyal.&rdquo; He then mounts his
      horse, caracoles about, brandishing his lance, and afterwards in the
      courtyard he repeats the performances before the people ever eager to take
      part in the spectacle.

      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The young knight was now able to take part in the jousts, and all kinds of
      chivalric displays, which were common and frequent. Many castles have,
      like that at Carisbrooke, a tilting-ground within the walls; but great and
      important tournaments were held outside the castle. Richard I. appointed
      five special places for the holding of tournaments, namely between Sarum
      and Wilton, between Stamford and Wallingford, between Warwick and
      Kenilworth, between Brakely and Mixeberg, and between Blie and Tykehill.
      There was much pomp and ceremony attached to these knightly exercises. The
      lists, as the barriers were called which inclosed the scene of combat,
      were superbly decorated, and surrounded by pavilions belonging to the
      champions, ornamented with their arms and banners. The seats reserved for
      the noble ladies and gentlemen who came to see the fight were hung with
      tapestry embroidered with gold and silver. Everyone was dressed in the
      most sumptuous manner; the minstrels and heralds were clothed in the
      costliest garments; the knights who were engaged in the sports and their
      horses were most gorgeously arrayed. The whole scene was one of great
      splendour and magnificence, and, when the fight began, the shouts of the
      heralds who directed the tournament, the clashing of arms, the clang of
      trumpets, the charging of the combatants, and the shouts of the
      spectators, must have produced a wonderfully impressive and exciting
      effect upon all who witnessed the strange spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The regulations and laws of the tournament were very minute. When many
      preliminary arrangements had been made with regard to the examination of
      arms and helmets and the exhibition of banners, etc., at ten o&rsquo;clock
      on the morning of the appointed day, the champions and their adherents
      were required to be in their places. Two cords divided the combatants, who
      were armed with a pointless sword and a truncheon hanging from their
      saddles. When the word was given by the lord of the tournament, the cords
      were removed, and the champions charged and fought until the heralds
      sounded the signal to retire. It was considered the greatest disgrace to
      be unhorsed. A French earl once tried to unhorse our King Edward I., when
      he was returning from Palestine, wearied by the journey. The earl threw
      away his sword, cast his arms around the king&rsquo;s neck, and tried to
      pull him from his horse. But Edward put spurs to his horse and drew the
      earl from the saddle, and then shaking him violently, threw him to the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      The joust (or just) differed from the tournament, because in the former
      only lances were used, and only two knights could fight at once. It was
      not considered quite so important as the grand feat of arms which I have
      just described, but was often practised when the more serious encounter
      had finished. Lances, or spears without heads of iron, were commonly used,
      and the object of the sport was to ride hard against one&rsquo;s adversary
      and strike him with the spear upon the front of the helmet, so as to beat
      him backwards from his horse, or break the spear. This kind of sport was
      of course rather dangerous, and men sometimes lost their lives at these
      encounters. In order to lessen the risk and danger of the two horses
      running into each other when the knights charged, a boarded railing was
      erected in the midst of the lists, about four or five feet high. The
      combatants rode on separate sides of this barrier, and therefore they
      could not encounter each other except with their lances. Sometimes two
      knights would fight in mortal combat. If one knight accused the other of
      crime or dishonour, the latter might challenge him to fight with swords or
      lances; and, according to the superstition of the times, the victor was
      considered to be the one who spoke the truth. But this ordeal combat was
      far removed from the domain of sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      When jousts and tournaments were abandoned, tilting on horseback at a ring
      became a favourite courtly amusement. A ring was suspended on a level with
      the eye of the rider; and the sport consisted in riding towards the ring,
      and sending the point of a lance through it, and so bearing it away. Great
      skill was required to accomplish this surely and gracefully. Ascham, a
      writer in the sixteenth century, tells us what accomplishments were
      required from the complete English gentleman of the period:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To ride comely, to run fair at the tilt or ring, to play at all
      weapons, to shoot fair in bow, or surely in gun; to vault lustily, to run,
      to leap, to wrestle, to swim, to dance comely, to sing, and play of
      instruments cunningly; to hawk, to hunt, to play at tennis, and all
      pastimes generally which be joined to labour, containing either some fit
      exercises for war, or some pleasant pastime for peace&mdash;these be not
      only comely and decent, but also very necessary for a courtly gentleman to
      use.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the days of pageants and royal progresses these old castles were the
      scenes of very lively exhibitions of rustic histrionic talent. The stories
      of Greek and Roman mythology were ransacked to provide scenes and subjects
      for the rural pageant. Shepherds and shepherdesses, gods and goddesses,
      clowns and mummers, all took part in the rural drama which kings and
      queens delighted to honour. When Queen Elizabeth visited the ancient and
      historic castle of Sudeley, great preparations were made for the event,
      and a fine classical pageant was performed in her presence, a sketch of
      which may not be without interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The play is founded on the old classical story of Apollo and Daphne. The
      sun-god Apollo was charmed by the beauty of the fair Daphne, the daughter
      of a river-god, and pursued her with base intent. Just as she was about to
      be overtaken, she prayed for aid, and was immediately changed into a
      laurel tree, which became the favourite tree of the disappointed lover.
      The pageant founded on this old classical legend commenced with a man who
      acted the part of Apollo, chasing a woman who represented Daphne, followed
      by a young shepherd bewailing his hard fate. He, too, loved the fair and
      beautiful Daphne, but Apollo wooed her with fair words, and threatened him
      with diverse penalties, saying he would change him into a wolf, or a
      cockatrice, or blind his eyes. The shepherd in a long speech tells how
      Daphne was changed into a tree, and then Apollo is seen at the foot of a
      laurel tree weeping, accompanied by two minstrels. The repentant god
      repeats the verse:&mdash;
    </p>
    <table summary="poems">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sing you, play you; but sing and play my truth;<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;This tree my lute, these sighs my note of ruth:<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;The laurel leaf for ever shall be green,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;And
            chastity shall be Apollo&rsquo;s queen.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;If gods may
            die, here shall my tomb be placed,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;And this
            engraven, &lsquo;Fond Phoebus, Daphne chaste.&rsquo;&rdquo;
          </p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      A song follows, and then, wonderful to relate, the tree opens, and Daphne
      comes forth. Apollo resigns her to the humble shepherd, and then she runs
      to Her Majesty the Queen, and with a great deal of flattery wishes her a
      long and prosperous reign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the simple play which delighted the minds of our forefathers, and
      helped to raise them from sordid cares and the dull monotony of continual
      toil. In our popular amusements the village folk do not take part, except
      as spectators, and therefore lose half the pleasure; whereas in the time
      of the Virgin Queen the rehearsals, the learning the speeches by heart,
      the dresses, the excitement, all contributed to give them fresh ideas and
      new thoughts. The acting may not have been very good; indeed Queen
      Elizabeth did not always think very highly of the performances of her
      subjects at Coventry, and was heard to exclaim, &ldquo;What fools ye
      Coventry folk are!&rdquo; But I think Her Majesty must have been pleased
      at the concluding address of the players at Sudeley. After the shepherds
      had acted a piece in which the election of the King and Queen of the Bean
      formed a part, they knelt before the real queen, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, dread Sovereign, poor shepherds&rsquo; pastimes, and bold
      shepherds&rsquo; presumptions. We call ourselves kings and queens to make
      mirth; but when we see a king or queen we stand amazed. At chess there are
      kings and queens, and they of wood. Shepherds are no more, nor no less,
      wooden. In theatres workmen have played emperors; yet the next day
      forgotten neither their duties nor occupation. For our boldness in
      borrowing their names, and in not seeing Your Majesty for our blindness,
      we offer these shepherds&rsquo; weeds; which, if Your Majesty vouchsafe at
      any time to wear, it shall bring to our hearts comfort, and happiness to
      our labours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the queen visited Kenilworth Castle, splendid pageants were performed
      in her honour. As she entered the castle the gigantic porter recited
      verses to greet Her Majesty, gods and goddesses offered gifts and
      compliments on bended knee, and the Lady of the Lake, surrounded by
      Tritons and Nereids, came on a floating island to do homage to the
      peerless Elizabeth and to welcome her to all the sport the castle could
      afford. For an account of the strange conduct of Orion and his dolphin
      upon this occasion, we refer our readers to Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s <i>Kenilworth</i>;
      and the lover of pageants will find much to interest him in Gascoigne&rsquo;s
      <i>Princely Progress</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glories of our ancient castles have passed away; some indeed are
      preserved, and serve as museums, or barracks, or the country house of some
      noble lord; but most of them are in ruins. All traces of many a Norman
      castle have completely vanished. There was once a castle at Reading, but
      the only relics of it are the names Castle Hill and Castle Street. The
      turbulent barons made such terrible use of their fortresses during the
      troublous times of the civil war in Stephen&rsquo;s reign that in the more
      settled reign of Henry II. they were deprived of this means of oppression
      and their castles destroyed wholesale. The civil war in the reign of
      Charles I. was also another great cause of the destruction of these old
      fortresses. They were of great service during the progress of the war to
      those who were fortunate enough to possess them, and many of them in spite
      of Cromwell&rsquo;s cannon were most gallantly held and stoutly defended.
      Donnington Castle, Berkshire, was bravely held in spite of a prolonged
      siege during all the time that the war lasted by gallant Colonel Boys, who
      beat off the flower of the Parliamentary army; and when in obedience to
      the King&rsquo;s command he yielded up the castle, he and his brave
      garrison marched out with all the honours of war, having earned the
      respect of both friend and foe. Many other castles could tell the story of
      similar sieges in the days when &ldquo;the gallants of England were up for
      the King.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But these brave sieges were the cause of their destruction. Cromwell when
      in power recognised their strength; they were too dangerous, these
      castles, and must be destroyed. His cannon-balls had rattled against their
      stone walls without much effect during the war; but their fate was sealed
      with that of their King, and the gunpowder of Cromwell&rsquo;s soldiers
      was soon employed in blowing up the walls that resisted him so long, and
      left them battered and smoking ruins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then the ivy has grown over them to hide their nakedness. Forlorn
      and lonely the ruined castle stands. Where once loud clarion rang, the
      night owls hoot; vulgar crowds picnic where once knights fought in all the
      pride and pomp of chivalry. Kine feed in the grass-grown bailey court; its
      glory is departed. We need no castles now to protect us from the foes of
      our own nation. Civil wars have passed away, we trust, for ever; and we
      hope no foreign foeman&rsquo;s foot may ever tread our shores. But if an
      enemy threatened to attack England her sons would fight as valiantly as in
      the brave days of old, though earthen ramparts have replaced the ancient
      castles and iron ships the old wooden walls of England.

    </p>
    <p>
      In the neighbourhood of many of our villages stand the ruins of an old
      monastery. Who were the builders of these grand and stately edifices? What
      kind of men lived within those walls? What life did they lead? We will try
      to picture to ourselves the condition of these noble abbeys, as they were
      in the days of their glory, before the ruthless hands of spoilers and
      destroyers robbed them of their magnificence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has often been remarked that the monks knew well how to choose the most
      beautiful spots for their monastic houses, establishing them by the banks
      of some charming river, surrounded by beautiful scenery and fertile
      fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      They loved the beauties of nature, and had a keen sense for discovering
      them. They had a delicate and profound appreciation of the delights of the
      country, and loved to describe the beauties that surrounded their
      habitations. Nature in its loveliness and wild picturesqueness was a
      reflection of God&rsquo;s beauty, a temple of His light and goodness.
      Moreover they built their monasteries amidst forests and wild scenery, far
      from the haunts of men, seeking solitude, wherein they could renew their
      souls by the sweetness of a life of contemplation, and consecrate their
      energies to the service of God. In the days of war and bloodshed, of
      oppression and lawlessness, holy men found it very difficult to be &ldquo;in
      the world and yet not of it.&rdquo; Within the monastic walls they found
      peace, seclusion, solitude; they prayed, they worked, they wrote and
      studied. They were never idle. To worship, to labour, to fight as the <i>milites
      Christi</i> with weapons that were not carnal, these were some of the
      duties of the monks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world owes much to these dwellers in monasteries. They rescued the
      people from barbarism, and uplifted the standard of the cross. They
      emerged from their cells to direct councils, to preach and teach at the
      universities, to build churches and cathedrals, and astonish the world by
      their skill and learning. Who can tell what services they rendered to
      their nation and to all mankind by pouring forth that ceaseless stream of
      intercession day and night for the averting of the judgments of divine
      wrath which the crimes and follies of men so richly deserved? &ldquo;What
      the sword is to the huntsman, prayer is to the monk,&rdquo; says St.
      Chrysostom; and well did they use this weapon for the spiritual and
      material benefit of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another great benefit they conferred upon the world was that of charity.
      They were the true nurses of the poor. There were no poor laws, and union
      workhouses, and hospitals. The monks managed to supply all the wants of
      all who suffered from poverty, privation, and sickness. &ldquo;The
      friendship of the poor constitutes us the friends of kings,&rdquo; says
      St. Bernard; &ldquo;but the love of poverty makes kings of us.&rdquo; They
      welcomed in their ranks poor men, who were esteemed as highly as those of
      noble birth on entering the cloister. All men were equal who wore the monk&rsquo;s
      robe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst other services the monks rendered was the cultivation of learning
      and knowledge. With wonderful assiduity they poured forth works of
      erudition, of history, of criticism, recorded the annals of their own
      times, and stored these priceless records in their libraries, which have
      done such good service to the historians of modern times. The monasteries
      absorbed nearly all the social and intellectual movement of the thirteenth
      century. Men fired with poetical imagination frequently betook themselves
      to the cloister, and consecrated their lives to the ornamentation of a
      single sacred book destined for the monastery which gave them in exchange
      all the necessaries of life. Thus the libraries of the monastic houses
      were rich in treasures of beautifully illuminated manuscripts, which were
      bound by members of the community. The Abbot of Spanheim in the fifteenth
      century gives the following directions to his monks:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let that one fasten the leaves together, and bind the book with
      boards. You, prepare those boards; you, dress the leather; you, the metal
      plates, which are to adorn the binding.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      <br />NETLEY ABBEY, SOUTH TRANSEPT <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Terrible is it to think of the dreadful destruction of these libraries at
      the time of the spoliation of monasteries and of the priceless treasures
      which they contained.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are apt to suppose that the lives of the monks were gloomy, hard,
      severe, and that few rays of the sunshine of happiness could have
      penetrated the stern walls of the cloister. But this does not appear to
      have been the case. The very names of monasteries show that they rejoiced
      in their solitude and labour. Netley Abbey was called the Joyous Place, <i>loeto
      loco</i>; and on the Continent there are many names which bear witness to
      the happiness that reigned in the cloister. Moreover the writings of the
      monks proclaim the same truth. Cluny is called by Peter Damien his <i>hortus
      deliciarum</i> (garden of delights), and it is recorded that when Peter de
      Blois left the Abbey of Croyland to return to France he stopped seven
      times to look back and contemplate again the place where he had been so
      happy. Hear how Alcuin laments on leaving the cloister for the Court of
      Charlemagne:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O my cell! sweet and well-beloved home, adieu for ever! I shall see
      no more the woods which surround thee with their interlacing branches and
      aromatic herbs, nor thy streams of fish, nor thy orchards, nor thy gardens
      where the lily mingles with the rose. I shall hear no more those birds
      who, like ourselves, sing matins and celebrate their Creator, in their
      fashion&mdash;nor those instructions of sweet and holy wisdom which sound
      in the same breath as the praises of the Most High, from lips and hearts
      always peaceful. Dear cell! I shall weep thee and regret thee always.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The life was very peaceful, entirely free from care, and moreover lighted
      by the whole-hearted friendships which existed between the brethren. A
      chapter might be written on the love of the cloister, which like that of
      David for Jonathan, was &ldquo;wonderful, passing the love of women.&rdquo;
      Thus St. Bernard burst out in bitter grief at the loss of a brother monk:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flow, flow, my tears, so eager to flow! he who prevented your
      flowing is here no more! It is not he who is dead, it is I who now live
      only to die. Why, oh, why have we loved, and why have we lost each other?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The letters of Anselm to Lanfranc and Gondulph, his dearest friends,
      abound in expressions of the most affectionate regard and deep true
      friendship. He writes:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I forget thee? Can a man forget one who is placed like a
      seal upon his heart? In thy silence I know that thou lovest me; and thou
      also, when I say nothing, thou knowest that I love thee. What can my
      letter tell thee that thou knowest not already, thou who art my second
      soul?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The monks&rsquo; lot was not sad and melancholy. They loved God and His
      service, and rejoicing in their mutual regard and affection were happy in
      their love and work. Orderic Vitalis writes, &ldquo;I have borne for
      forty-two years with happiness the sweet yoke of the Lord.&rdquo; Moreover
      they shed happiness on those who dwelt around them, on the crowds of
      masons and carpenters, traders and workmen, who dwelt under the shadow of
      the monastery or farmed the fields of the monastic estates. No institution
      was ever more popular; no masters more beloved. They took a hearty
      interest in the welfare of all their tenants, and showed an active
      sympathy for all. The extent of their charity was enormous. In a French
      abbey, when food was scarce, they fed 1,500 to 2,000 poor in the course of
      the year, gave monthly pensions to all the families who were unable to
      work, entertained 4,000 guests, and maintained eighty monks&mdash;a
      wonderful record truly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The influence of the monastery was felt in all the surrounding
      neighbourhood&mdash;the daily services, the solemn and majestic chants,
      the processions, must have created a deep impression on the minds of
      people. Many of the great writers and thinkers of subsequent ages have
      appreciated the wonderful labours of the monks. Dr. Johnson wrote:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never read of a hermit, but in imagination I kiss his feet; never
      of a monastery, but I fall on my knees and kiss the pavement.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And now these noble buildings, hallowed by a thousand memories, exist only
      as dishonoured ruins. Some have been pulled down entirely, and the site
      used for gaols or barracks. Convicts labour where once monks prayed. The
      renowned abbey of Cluny is a racing stable, and Le Bec, the home of
      Anselm, has suffered a like profanation. Factories have invaded some of
      these consecrated sites. Many have been used as quarries for generations.
      All the carved and wrought stone has been cut off, and used for making
      bridges and roads and private houses. Nature has covered the remains with
      clinging ivy, and creeping plants, and wild flowers, and legends cluster
      round the old stones and tell the story of their greatness and their ruin.
      The country folk of western Ireland show the marks on the stones furrowed
      by the burning tears of the monks when they were driven out of their holy
      home. I am describing the condition of the monasteries in the days of
      their glory, when the spirit of the religious orders was bright and pure
      and enthusiastic. It cannot be denied that often the immense wealth which
      kings and nobles poured into the treasury of the monks begat luxury and
      idleness. Boccaccio in Italy, and even Dante, and our own Chaucer, write
      vigorously against the corruption of the monks, their luxury, love of
      sport, and neglect of their duty. Thus Chaucer wrote of a
      fourteenth-century prior:&mdash;

    <p>
      Many were the efforts to reform the abuses which crept into the monastic
      houses. Holy men grieved over the scandals of the times in which they
      lived. Many monasteries remained until the end homes of zeal and religion,
      and the unscrupulous tools of Henry VIII. could find naught to report
      against them. The only charge they could fabricate against one monastery
      was &ldquo;that the monks would do evil, if they could.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The foundation of the various orders of monks shows the efforts which were
      from time to time made by earnest men to revive the zeal and religious
      enthusiasm characteristic of the early dwellers in monasteries. The
      followers of St. Benedict and St. Columba were the first monks of the
      western Church who converted the peoples of England, Germany, Belgium, and
      Scandinavia. The Benedictines had many houses in England in Saxon times.
      In the tenth and eleventh centuries flourished a branch of the
      Benedictines, the order of Cluny, who worked a great religious revival,
      which was continued in the twelfth by the order of the Cistercians,
      founded at Citeaux in Burgundy. Some of our most beautiful English abbeys&mdash;Fountains,
      Kirkstall, Rievaulx, Tintern, Furness, and Byland&mdash;all belonged to
      this order. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the new orders of
      preaching friars founded by St. Francis and St. Dominic arose, and
      exercised an immense influence in the world. They did not shut themselves
      up in the cloister, but went everywhere, preaching in the market-places,
      and tending the sick, the lepers, and the outcasts. At first they were
      immensely popular, but the orders degenerated like their predecessors, and
      long before the Reformation laid themselves open to the derision and the
      scoffs of the more enlightened men of the age. Since the days of the
      Friars there has been no building of monasteries in England. Wealth,
      luxury, and corruption had destroyed the early piety of the monks, and
      rich men preferred to give their wealth for the purpose of founding
      colleges and hospitals, rather than in increasing the number of religious
      houses.

      We will now visit these monasteries, and try to picture them as they stood
      in the days of their glory, and see the daily life which the monks led.
      The rules of the orders differed somewhat, some being stricter than
      others; and likewise the arrangements of the buildings were not all based
      upon one plan. The Carthusian monasteries differ widely from those of the
      other orders, owing to the rule that each monk should have his separate
      cell, wherein he lived and had his food, and only met his brethren in
      church and in the chapter-house. We will examine the usual plan of a
      monastery, the main buildings of which clustered round the cloister-court.
      This was called the paradise, around which was a covered ambulatory. Here
      the monks read and wrote, and sometimes had little spaces partitioned off
      for studies, with bookstands and cupboards. It was the great centre of the
      monastic life. The earlier ambulatories were open, but in the fourteenth
      century they had windows looking on to the cloister-court, filled with
      stained glass. The monks must have found the open cloister a somewhat
      chilly place for writing, and although their fingers were endured to
      hardness, had sometimes to abandon their tasks. Orderic Vitalis tells us
      that his fingers were so numbed by the cold in a hard winter that he was
      obliged to leave his writing until a more congenial season.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the north of the cloister-court stood the monastic church, the grandest
      and noblest of the monastic buildings, adorned with shrines, and tombs,
      and altars. Several of our cathedrals were monastic churches, and afford
      us some idea of the splendour and magnificence of these stately buildings.
      Many other churches built by the monks, quite as large and noble as any of
      our cathedrals, are now in ruins, with only a wall or a buttress remaining
      to mark the site of the once noble minster. The church was usually
      cruciform, with nave and aisles. East of the high altar in the choir stood
      the lady-chapel, and round the choir a retro-choir, or presbytery. There
      was a door on the south side of the church, opposite the eastern
      ambulatory, for the entrance of the monks. The south transept formed part
      of the eastern side of the cloister. On the same side stood the
      chapter-house, a large chamber richly ornamented with much architectural
      detail, and adorned with mural paintings. Between the chapter-house and
      the church there is a narrow room, which was the sacristy, and on the
      south of the chapter-house a building in two stories, the ground floor
      being the frater-house, where the monks retired after meals to converse,
      the upper room being the dortor, or dormitory, where they slept. A passage
      often separated the chapter-house from this building.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the south side of the cloister-court stood the refectory, a long room
      in which the monks took their meals; and on the west was a range of
      buildings the use of which differed in various monasteries, in some for
      cellars and larders, in others for dormitories. Sometimes this western
      building was the <i>domus conversorum</i>, or house of the lay brethren.
      The abbot&rsquo;s lodging was a fine house, consisting of hall, chambers,
      kitchen, buttery, and cellars, capable of entertaining a large number of
      guests, and frequently stood on the east side of the chapter-house quite
      separate from the other buildings. In small monastic houses governed by a
      prior his residence often formed the western side of the cloister-court.
      The farmery, or infirmary, where sick monks were nursed during illness,
      was a separate building, having its own kitchen, refectory, and chapel.
      The hospitium was also a separate building near the outer gate of the
      abbey, and consisted of a hall, dormitories, and a chapel, in which each
      night a goodly company of guests were entertained and courteously welcomed
      by the hospitaller. A high wall surrounded the abbey precincts, in which
      was the outer gate, consisting of a porter&rsquo;s lodge, a prison, and a
      large room in which the manorial court was held, or the abbot met the
      representatives of the townsfolk in order to direct their affairs and
      choose their chief magistrate or settle their differences.

      The author of <i>Piers Ploughman</i> gives a description of the appearance
      of a monastery in the fourteenth century. As he approached the monastic
      buildings he was so bewildered by their greatness and beauty that for a
      long time he could distinguish nothing certainly but stately buildings of
      stone, pillars carved and painted, and great windows well wrought. In the
      centre quadrangle he notices the stone cross in the middle of grass sward.
      He enters the minster, and describes the arches as carved and gilded, the
      wide windows full of shields of arms and merchants&rsquo; marks on stained
      glass, the high tombs under canopies, with armed effigies in alabaster,
      and lovely ladies lying by their sides in many gay garments. He passes
      into the cloister, and sees it pillared and painted, and covered with
      lead, and conduits of white metal pouring water into bronze lavatories
      beautifully wrought. The chapter-house was like a great church, carved and
      painted like a parliament-house. Then he went into the refectory, and
      found it a hall fit for a knight and his household, with broad tables and
      clean benches, and windows wrought as in a church. And then he wandered
      and wondered at &ldquo;the halls full high and houses full noble, chambers
      with chimneys and chapels gay,&rdquo; and kitchens fit for a king in his
      castle, and their dorter or dormitory with doors full strong, their
      fermerye (infirmary) and frater, and many more houses, and strong stone
      walls, enough to harbour the queen. The author was evidently amazed at all
      the sights which he witnessed in the monastery.

      We will now see the monks at work, and spend a day with them in their
      monastic home. It is not easy definitely to map out a monk&rsquo;s day.
      The difficulty arises in a measure from the want of distinct marks of
      time. A monastic day was divided into twelve hours of uncertain length,
      varying according to the season; but the religious observances began at
      midnight, when the brethren rose at the sound of a bell in the dortor for
      the continuous service of Mattins and Lauds. They then retired to sleep,
      until the bell again summoned them at sunrise, when Prime was said,
      followed by the morning Mass, private masses and confessions, and the
      meeting of the Chapter; after this, work; then Tierce; then High Mass,
      followed by Sext. A short time was then devoted to reading, during which
      the <i>ministri</i> and the reader at table dined; and then the monks sat
      down to dinner. This was the first food of the day, though the weaker
      brethren were allowed to sustain themselves with wine and water, or bread
      steeped in wine. Dinner was followed by a brief rest in the dormitory. If
      the monks did not wish to sleep they could read in the dorter; but they
      were to be careful not to disturb their resting brethren by any noise,
      such as that caused by turning over the leaves of their books. At one o&rsquo;clock
      the bell rang for None, a short service consisting of a hymn, two psalms,
      some collects, the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, and versicles. Then the brethren
      washed themselves, had a stoup of wine in the frater, and worked until
      Evensong, which was followed by supper. After supper they read in the
      cloister until the bell rang for Collation, which consisted of a reading
      in the chapter-house, whence they retired to the fratery for a draught of
      wine or beer. Then followed Compline, and then the monks were ready for
      bed, and retired to the dortor. Even there rules followed them, and
      directed them how they were to take off their shoes, and &ldquo;to behave
      with more quiet, self-restraint, and devotion than elsewhere.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not exhausted all the services which the monks attended. In
      addition to the principal ones there were several minor functions, at
      which devotion to the Blessed Virgin was the chief feature. The life was
      hard and the discipline severe; and lest the animal spirits of the monks
      should rise too high, the course of discipline was supplemented by
      periodical blood-letting. The doctors of the day were firm believers in
      the utility of this practice, and perhaps it had special advantages for
      dwellers in monasteries. According to the mediaeval metrical treatise on
      medicine, <i>Flos Medicinae</i>, or <i>Regimen Sanitatis Salerni</i>&mdash;

      According to the <i>Observances</i> of the Augustinian Priory at Barnwell,
      Cambridge, each brother was compelled to be bled seven times a year. It
      was probably a welcome duty, as the monks enjoyed a regular holiday, and
      were solaced with unwonted good fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who wished to be bled asked leave in Chapter, and having received a
      formal licence, attended High Mass. After the gospel they left the quire,
      and were bled in the farmery, where they remained three days. During this
      period they were excused attendance at the daily services, except on very
      special occasions; and minute directions are given for their personal
      comfort. They were allowed fire and lights, with suitable food, eggs and
      vegetables being specially mentioned; and they might take exercise within
      the precincts, and even beyond them, should the prelate give them leave.
      The infirmary seems to have been the most cheerful place in the monastery.
      Its inmates were &ldquo;to lead a life of joy and freedom from care, in
      comfort and happiness.&rdquo; Conversation was freely permitted, though
      sarcastic and abusive language was strictly forbidden. &ldquo;Games of
      dice and chess, and other games unsuitable to those who lead a religious
      life, were forbidden&rdquo;; &ldquo;because beyond all doubt they are
      offensive to God, and frequently give occasion to strife and contention
      among those who play them.&rdquo; We notice that invalids were allowed to
      walk in the &ldquo;vineyards&rdquo;; evidently the monks grew their own
      grapes, and made their own wine. The infirmary must have been well
      frequented. The complaints which are often specially mentioned as likely
      to compel the monks to resort to it are &ldquo;irksomeness of life in the
      cloister,&rdquo; &ldquo;long continuance of silence,&rdquo; &ldquo;fatigue
      in the quire or extension of fasting,&rdquo; and &ldquo;sleeplessness and
      overwork.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With regard to blood-letting the various orders had different customs. The
      Benedictines and Cluniacs had no stated times or seasons for the
      operation. The Cistercians prescribe bleeding four times in the year. The
      Carthusians were bled five times, and the Dominicans four times in the
      year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The food of the monastery was varied and plentiful. Fish and flesh were
      brought to the table, the former being obtained from the monastic
      stew-ponds. Fruit was supplied, both raw and cooked, and a good supply of
      beer and wine. Wine seems to have been very commonly used, and some
      relaxation was evidently permitted in the matter of drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hospitium, or guest-house, is worthy of a visit. Thither flocked a
      mixed crowd of knights and dames, monks and clerks, palmers, friars,
      traders with their wares, minstrels with their songs, and beggars,
      enjoying to the full the hospitality of the monks, who recognised it as
      one of their duties &ldquo;to entertain strangers.&rdquo; The religious
      houses were, to a great extent, the inns of the Middle Ages; and when they
      were situated on the high roads, the guests were numerous and their
      entertainment costly. We are reminded, however, by the <i>Observances</i>
      of Barnwell Priory that &ldquo;by showing hospitality to guests the
      reputation of the monastery is increased, friendships are multiplied,
      animosities are blunted, God is honoured, charity is increased, and a
      plenteous reward in heaven is promised.&rdquo; It was enjoined that the
      hosteller, or brother in charge of the hospitium, should have &ldquo;facility
      of expression, elegant manners, and a respectable bringing up; and if he
      have no substance to bestow he may at any rate exhibit a cheerful
      countenance and agreeable conversation, for friends are multiplied by
      agreeable words.&rdquo; He had to provide clean cloths and towels, cups
      without flaws, spoons of silver, mattresses, blankets and untorn sheets,
      pillows, quilts, etc. His duties are laid down with much minuteness; every
      morning he was required to go through the inventory, lest anything should
      be missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting in the chapter-house we must not omit to describe. When all
      the brethren had taken their seats, one monk went to the pulpit and read
      aloud the martyrology for the day. Then some psalms and collects were
      read, and a portion of the monastic rule, and briefs announcing the deaths
      of persons in whom the brethren were interested. The <i>tabula</i>, or
      notice-board, recording the names of those who were responsible for
      certain duties, was read; and a sermon followed. After the precentor had
      given minute instructions with regard to the reading and singing of the
      services for the day, the abbot said: &ldquo;Speak of your own order.&rdquo;
      This was the call to confession; and any brother who was conscious that he
      had transgressed any rule, or neglected his duty, came forward and asked
      pardon for his fault. This was followed by the report of the <i>circator</i>,
      whose duty was to play the spy, and discover the faults of the monks. And
      after this the brethren accused each other. One brother started up saying:
      &ldquo;I accuse &mdash;&mdash; a brother.&rdquo; The accused came forward
      and stood before the abbot, waiting patiently for the charge. The accuser
      then stated the charge, which was admitted, or denied, by the accused. If
      the abbot judged him to be flogged, the culprit might not be flogged by
      his accuser. He rose from his knees and modestly divested himself of his
      garments, remaining covered from his girdle downwards; and he who flogged
      him might not cease till the abbot bade him. Then he helped the brother to
      put on his clothes, who bowed to the abbot and went back to his place. The
      Chapter, after this exciting interlude, proceeded to transact the temporal
      business of the house, and then adjourned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chapter-house was often the scene of great events in the history of
      England. At Reading Abbey in this noble chamber parliaments were held.
      Here Heraclius, the patriarch of Jerusalem, presented to Henry II. the
      keys of the Holy Sepulchre, and invoked his aid in the crusade against the
      Saracens. Here the bishops assembled and excommunicated Longchamp,
      Chancellor and Regent of the country. Here the marriage contract between
      John of Gaunt and Blanche of Lancaster was signed, when there were great
      rejoicings in the ancient town, and tilts and tournaments took place
      daily. These gay scenes must have greatly disturbed the tranquil life of
      the monks, and contrasted strangely with their normal condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The picture of monastic life, which a study of the records of a monastery
      brings before us, is strange and alien to our present ideas; but it is
      brightened by a spirit of sincere religion and true charity, and helps us
      to understand the attraction of the convent walls in turbulent and
      troublous times.

      The two principal houses in an English village are the manor-house and the
      rectory, wherein according to the theories of the modern political
      Socialist and agitator &ldquo;the two arch-tyrants&rdquo; of the labourers
      dwell, the squire and the parson. There is much of interest in the growth
      and evolution of the country house, which resulted in the construction of
      these old, pleasant, half-timbered granges and manor-houses, which form
      such beautiful features of our English villages.

      In our description of the village in Anglo-Saxon times we gave a picture
      of a house of a Saxon gentleman, which consisted mainly of one large hall,
      wherein the members of the household lived and slept and had their meals.
      There was a chapel, and a kitchen, and a ladies&rsquo; bower, usually
      separated from the great hall, and generally built of wood. In Norman
      times the same plan and arrangements of a country house continued. The
      fire still burnt in the centre of the hall, the smoke finding its way out
      through a louvre in the roof. Meals were still served on tables laid on
      trestles, which were removed when the meal was finished. The lord and
      lady, their family and guests, dined at the high table placed on the dais,
      as in a college hall, the floor of which was boarded. The household and
      retainers dined in the space below, which was strewn with rushes and
      called &ldquo;the marsh,&rdquo; which, according to Turner&rsquo;s <i>History
      of Domestic Architecture</i>, &ldquo;was doubtless dirty and damp enough
      to deserve that name.&rdquo; The timbers of the roof in the better houses
      were moulded, the walls hung with tapestry, and at the lower end of the
      hall was a screen, above which in later times was the minstrels&rsquo;
      gallery. The screen formed a passage which led into a separate building at
      right angles to the hall, containing the cellar, buttery, and kitchen.
      Parallel with this at the upper end of the hall was a building of two
      stories, one used as a parlour, and the other was called the &ldquo;great
      chamber,&rdquo; where the lady and her guests retired after dining in the
      hall.

    <p>
      Later on a greater refinement of domestic customs was introduced. In the
      twelfth century a separate sleeping-chamber for the lord was added. The
      next century saw him and his lady dining in a room apart from his
      servants, a custom which was much satirised by the author of <i>Piers
      Ploughman</i>, who wrote&mdash;

    <p>
      Evidently the author did not approve of the new fashion. But the
      advantages of the custom were much appreciated by the squires and ladies
      of the day, and this process of development led to a multiplication of
      rooms, and the diminution of the size of the great hall. The walls were
      raised, and an upper room was formed under the roof for sleeping
      accommodation. There are many old farmhouses throughout the country, once
      manor-houses, which retain in spite of subsequent alterations the
      distinguishing features of this mediaeval style of architecture.

      The nobles built their castles as late as the fourteenth century; but
      under the Tudor monarchs, when the government of the country was strong
      and more settled, fortified dwellings were deemed no longer necessary, and
      the great landowners built splendid country houses. English domestic
      architecture then reached the period of its highest perfection. Instead of
      castles men built palaces, the noblest specimens of our English style,
      before it became corrupted. Hatfield House and Hampton Court are its best
      examples.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the fifteenth century the common hall had decreased in importance;
      and now in smaller houses it disappeared altogether, and a grand entrance
      hall usually took its place. The number of rooms was increased enormously,
      and corridors were introduced. The principal features of an Elizabethan
      house are the gallery and noble staircase.

      Early in the seventeenth century Inigo Jones introduced the revived
      classic style of architecture into England, and entirely altered the
      appearance and arrangement of our manor-houses. Palladio was the
      originator of this style. The old English model was declared obsolete, and
      fashion dictated that Italian villas must supersede the old houses. These
      new buildings were very grand with their porticos and colonnades; but the
      architects cared little for comfort and convenience. Indeed a witty
      nobleman suggested to the owner of one of these new houses that he had
      better hire a lodging over the way and look at it.

      <br />OLD MANOR HOUSE, UPTON COURT <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The old manor-houses are often surrounded by a moat, and not unfrequently
      contain secret rooms and underground passages, which were often used as
      places of refuge in troublous times. Those held by recusants usually had
      two or three hiding-places ingeniously contrived, which must have baffled
      all pursuers, and were needed for the concealment of the Roman Catholic
      priest, in the days when his services were proscribed. There are two
      cleverly designed hiding-places at Ufton Court, Berkshire, which was held
      by the Roman Catholic family of Perkins. In a subterranean vault under an
      old house at Hurley, in which the bones of monks were discovered, the
      supporters of William of Orange used to meet to plan his succession to the
      English Crown. The walls of many of the manor-houses and halls in

      The rectories and vicarages scattered over the country have passed through
      the same transformation as the manor-houses, which they much resembled.
      The rectory was often surrounded by a moat, with an entrance protected by
      a gatehouse. The duty of entertaining strangers and travellers was always
      duly recognised by the clergy, and entailed a heavy charge upon their
      income. Those who lived off the main roads used to provide accommodation
      for an occasional guest, but the rectors in the more frequented districts
      had frequently to entertain many travellers. There <i>is</i> a description
      of the rectory-house of Kelvedon, Essex, in a deed dated 1356, which runs
      as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One hall situate in the manor of the said abbot and convent
      [Westminster] near the said church, with a soler and chamber at one end of
      the hall, and with a buttery and cellar at the other. Also one other house
      in three parts, namely a kitchen with a convenient chamber in the end of
      the said house <i>for guests</i>, and a bakehouse. Also one other house in
      two parts next the gate at the entrance of the manor for a stable and
      cow-house. He [the vicar] shall also have a convenient grange, to be built
      within a year at the expense of the prior and convent. He shall also have
      the curtilage with the garden adjoining the hall on the north side
      enclosed as it is with hedges and ditches.&rdquo;

    <p>
      Here the house for guests is an important feature of the clergyman&rsquo;s
      house; and about the same date, in 1352, we find the Bishop of Winchester
      ordering the prior and convent of Merton to provide &ldquo;a competent
      manse for the vicar, viz. a hall with two rooms, one at one end of the
      hall, and the other at the other end, with a drain to each, and a suitable
      kitchen with fireplace and oven, and a <i>stable for six horses</i>, all
      covered with tiles, and completed within one year, such place to remain to
      the use of the said vicar and his successors.&rdquo; Unless the vicar was
      a very sporting parson he would not require a stable for six horses, and
      this was doubtless intended for the accommodation of the steeds of his
      guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The descriptions of these old rectory-houses are interesting. The Rector
      of Allington, Kent, possessed a house consisting of &ldquo;a hall,
      parlour, and chamber over the parlour, stairs-head, beside the parson&rsquo;s
      bedchamber, parson&rsquo;s lodging-chamber, study, chamber behind the
      chimney, chamber next adjoining westward, buttery, priest&rsquo;s chamber,
      servants&rsquo; chamber, kitchen, mill-house, boulting-house, larder,
      entries, women&rsquo;s chamber; gatehouse, still beside the gate, barn
      next the gate; cartlage, barn next the church, garden-house, court.&rdquo;
      The barn next the church was probably the tithe-barn. Tithe was then paid
      in kind; hence a barn was required to contain the dues of the
      parishioners. Sometimes these tithe-barns are very large and long,
      especially when the tithe-owner was the abbot of some monastery. Near
      Reading there is still standing the barn of the abbey, and at Cholsey, in
      Berkshire, there is one of the finest specimens of the kind in England.

    <p>
      There still remain several of these old pre-Reformation parsonages and
      rectories. The most noted is the clergy-house at Alfriston, Sussex, which
      has been carefully preserved. It follows the usual type of
      fourteenth-century house, and consists of a fine hall, the lower part
      divided off by a screen, a soler of two stories at one end, and a kitchen
      at the other. It is built of oak framework, filled in with &ldquo;wattle
      and daub.&rdquo; There is a large chimney and grate in the hall, and huge
      beams support the thatched roof. Parsonages of mediaeval times remain at
      West Dean, Sussex; at King&rsquo;s Stanley and Notgrove, Gloucestershire;
      Wonstone, Hants; Helmsley, Yorkshire; and at several other places. The
      Rectory of Shellingford, Berks, though much disguised by modern additions,
      is an original fourteenth-century house.
    </p>
    <p>
      In many villages there are old almshouses founded by pious benefactors for
      &ldquo;poor brethren and sisters.&rdquo; As we enter the quiet courtyard
      paved with cobble stones, the spirit of olden days comes over us. The
      chapel where daily prayer is said morning and evening; the panelled
      dining-hall, with its dark oaken table; the comfortable rooms of the
      brethren; the time-worn pump in the courtyard&mdash;all recall the memory
      of old times, when life was more tranquil, and there was less hurry and
      busy bustling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes we meet with a curious little house built of stone or timber,
      erected along the great highways, near some bridge or ford, wherein a
      &ldquo;holy hermit&rdquo; once dwelt, and served his generation by
      directing travellers to the nearest monastery or rectory, and spent his
      days in seclusion and prayer. Such indeed is the traditional idea of the
      hermit&rsquo;s life; but the real hermit of the Middle Ages did not always
      live a very lonely or ascetic life. He was supported by the alms of the
      charitable and did no work, but lived an idle life, endured no hardships,
      and escaped not the scoffs of the satirical. <i>Piers Ploughman</i> tells
      us of workmen&mdash;&ldquo;webbers and tailors, and carters&rsquo; knaves,
      and clerks without grace, who liked not long labour and light wages; and
      seeing that lazy fellows in friars&rsquo; clothing had fat cheeks, forsook
      their toil and turned hermits. They lived in boroughs among brewers and
      begged in churches.&rdquo; They had a good house, with sometimes a
      chaplain to say daily Mass for them, a servant or two to wait on them, and
      plenty of food and drink provided by a regular endowment or the donations
      of the charitable. They did not shut themselves up in their cells and hold
      no intercourse with their fellow-men; and herein they differed from the
      recluses who were not supposed to go outside the doors of their
      anchorages. Both males and females were enrolled as recluses, but only the
      latter seem to have taken upon themselves the vows of complete seclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several of these hermitages remain. There is one at Little Budworth, in
      Cheshire, in the park of Sir Philip Egerton. Warkworth has a famous one,
      consisting of a chapel hewn out of the rock, with an entrance porch, and a
      long, narrow room with a small altar at the east end, wherein the hermit
      lived. At Knaresborough, Yorkshire, there is a good example of a
      hermitage, hewn out of the rock, consisting of a chapel, called St. Robert&rsquo;s
      Chapel, with groined roof, which was used as the living-room of the
      hermit. This chapel was the scene of Eugene Aram&rsquo;s murder. At
      Wetheral, near Carlisle; Lenton, near Nottingham; on the banks of the
      Severn, near Bewdley, Worcestershire, there are anchorages, and also at
      Brandon, Downham, and Stow Bardolph, in Norfolk. Spenser in the <i>Faery
      Queen</i> gives the following description of a hermit&rsquo;s cell:&mdash;

    <p>
      Within the churchyard of many a town or village church, and usually
      attached to the church, stood a reclusorium, or anchor-hold, wherein a
      recluse, male or female, once resided. At Laindon Church, Essex, there is
      a fine specimen of a house of this kind attached to the west end.
      Generally the anchor-hold was a small room, built of wood, connected with
      the church. Frequently there is a room over the porch of a church which
      may have been used for this purpose, the recluse living usually in the
      church. At Rettenden, Essex, there is a room over the vestry which has
      evidently been an anchor-hold. There was a window, now blocked up, through
      which the recluse could see the high altar, and the celebration of the
      holy mysteries, and another for him to look out, hold converse with his
      friends, and receive their alms. The church of St. Patricio, near
      Crickhowel, South Wales, has an anchor-hold; also Clifton Campville
      Church, Staffordshire; Chipping Norton Church, Oxfordshire; Warmington
      Church, Warwickshire; and many churches have rooms over the porch which
      were formerly used by recluses. The church itself was frequently the
      habitation of the anchorite. There is a notice of a hermit who lived in
      St. Cuthbert&rsquo;s Church, Thetford, and performed divine service
      therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of female recluses we gather many details in the <i>Ancren Riewle</i> of
      Bishop Poore of Salisbury, who left very minute directions for the
      regulation of their austere and solitary lives. The little cell had an
      altar where the anchoress frequently prayed, and through a window saw the
      elevation of the Host in the daily Mass. The walls were covered with mural
      paintings. There was a table, a fire, and a cat lying before it. An
      unglazed window with a shutter was covered by a black curtain, through
      which she could converse with anyone outside without being seen. She was
      not allowed to put her head out of the open window. &ldquo;A peering
      anchoress, who is always thrusting her head outward, is like an untamed
      bird in a cage,&rdquo; says the good bishop. The long hours of solitude
      were spent in devotion, working embroidery, reading her few books, talking
      to her servant or to those who desired to speak with her through the
      curtained window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor caged birds must often have wished to break the bars of their
      cage, and occasionally they escaped from their solitary confinement. In
      the churchyard of Whalley, Lancashire, there are two cottages which stand
      upon the site of a reclusorium, founded by Henry, Duke of Lancaster, in
      1349. Here in the reign of Henry VI. lived one Isole de Heton, who wearied
      of her lot, and left the anchor-hold, an example which was followed by
      several of her successors. A scandal having arisen, the hermitage was
      dissolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many a sad story of ruined hopes and broken hearts could these walls tell,
      which were the living tombs of many a devout or erring sister, who,
      wounded in the world&rsquo;s war, sought the calm seclusion of a cell, and
      found there the peace which elsewhere they had failed to find.

    </p>
    <p>
      In the centre of our village stands the church, always the most important
      and interesting building in the place. We will suppose that it has not
      suffered overmuch at the hands of the &ldquo;restorers&rdquo; of the
      nineteenth, or the Puritans of the seventeenth, or the spoliators of an
      earlier century, so that we may observe all those details which
      characterise an ancient church. In spite of all the vandalism which has
      taken place, in spite of the changes in ceremonial and forms of worship,
      our beautiful old churches still retain relics of the past which time has
      spared.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will enter the church and notice first the porch, often a large
      structure with a chamber above. Why was it made so large? According to the
      Sarum use several services took place in the porch. Parts of the baptismal
      service and of the marriage service and the churching of women were there
      performed; hence the porch was an important building, and it was necessary
      to make it rather large. Above the door there is frequently a niche for
      the image of the patron saint of the church, which has not usually escaped
      the destructive hand of the Puritan. The room over the porch was
      frequently inhabited by a recluse, as I have already recorded in the
      previous chapter. Near the door always stands the font, signifying that
      baptism is the entrance to the Church of Christ. Ancient fonts are large
      enough to allow the infant to be totally immersed, and are made of stone
      or lead. Childrey Church, in our county of Berks, has a fine cylindrical,
      leaden font, of Norman date, carved with figures of bishops. Norman fonts
      are frequently carved, the favourite subjects being the Baptism of our
      Lord, the Twelve Apostles, and the evangelistic symbols. Early English and
      Decorated fonts are not usually carved, but in the Perpendicular style
      they are rich with ornamentation, the Seven Sacraments being a not
      uncommon design. We have sometimes noticed the symbols of Freemasonry
      carved on fonts, as at Bray, in Berkshire. To the same period belong the
      splendid spire-shaped font-covers, of immense weight, of which I am
      sometimes a little fearful, lest the mechanism by which they are raised
      should become damaged, and terrible disaster follow during the progress of
      a baptismal service. At Sonning, Berks, there is a small stone desk
      attached to a pillar for the service-book to rest on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nave of the church is now filled with seats for the use of the
      congregation. In early times they do not seem to have been considered
      necessary, and until the fourteenth century the stone benches ranged
      against the walls were the only seats provided. Even as late as the
      fourteenth century it does not appear that many churches had pews, but in
      the fifteenth they became general. The hideous monstrosities of
      post-Reformation times did not then disfigure our churches. The pews were
      low open seats made of oak, sometimes carved at the back, and panelled,
      with the ends higher than the rest, and often richly carved. Many rich men
      left money in their wills for the <i>puying</i> of churches.

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until the beginning of the seventeenth century that the fashion
      of erecting high pews set in, which so disfigured our churches, and were
      frequently censured by the authorities. Some of these (as at Whalley)
      resemble four-posted beds; others are like cattle-pens, large square boxes
      with seats all round, wherein the occupants sit and sleep, screened from
      the rest of the congregation. The carving of the woodwork of these
      erections is often very elaborate. Modern pews are happily based upon the
      more primitive fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Preaching not being considered such an important part of the service in
      pre-Reformation times, pulpits in churches of that period were not so
      usual as in modern churches. Monastic refectories had pulpits, which the
      reader occupied when he read to his brethren during meals. Beaulieu Abbey
      has the most ancient pulpit in this country, which evidently belongs to
      the thirteenth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      The churches of Devonshire and Norfolk have wooden pulpits of the
      fifteenth century, which were painted and gilded, the figures of the four
      doctors of the church&mdash;SS. Augustine, Ambrose, Gregory, and Jerome&mdash;being
      the favourite subjects. In 1603 the churchwardens were ordered to provide
      in every church &ldquo;a comely and decent pulpit.&rdquo; Hence most of
      our pulpits date from this period. The sides were panelled and carved with
      scrollwork; and at the same time a sounding-board was introduced.
      Occasionally the hour-glass which regulated the length of the preacher&rsquo;s
      discourse remains, with its beautiful scroll-worked stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most striking feature of the pre-Reformation Church was the rood-loft,
      a narrow long gallery above the beautifully decorated screen, which
      separated the chancel from the nave. In this loft was erected the rood, or
      figure of our blessed Lord on the cross, together with figures of the
      Virgin and St. John on each side. Both the screen and the loft were richly
      panelled and ornamented with tracery and carvings, and before them hung
      one or more lamps. Sometimes tall candlesticks stood on pillars on each
      side of the figures. A staircase of stone, constructed in the wall near
      the chancel-arch, led to the rood-loft, and the blocked-up archway of this
      rood-stair frequently remains. The priest stood in the rood-loft to read
      the gospel and epistle, and sometimes preached there; official notices
      were read, and from it the bishop used to give the Benediction. The
      rood-cloth, or veil, hid the rood during Lent, and in some churches we
      have seen the roller which was used to raise this veil. A special altar,
      called the rood-altar, used to stand under the screen.
    </p>

      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reformers played havoc with these old rood-lofts and screens, which
      were regarded as monuments of idolatry and superstition. The churchwardens&rsquo;
      account-books of many churches bear witness to this destruction. Those of
      St. Giles&rsquo;, Reading, tell of certain <i>items</i> &ldquo;for pulling
      down the rood and carting away the rubbish.&rdquo; Instead of the figure
      of our Lord they put up the royal arms; and one John Serjente, of Hytchen,
      is licensed in 1614&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;to paynte in all the Churches and Chappells, within this Realme of
      England, the Kinges Majesties armes in due forme with helme creste mantell
      and supporters as they oughte to be&mdash;and to wright in fayre text
      letters the tenn commandments, the beliefe, and the Lord&rsquo;s prayer,
      with some other fruitefull and profitable sentences of holye scripture.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of this destruction of the ancient roods, several lofts still
      remain, <i>e.g.</i> at Bradninch, Cullompton, Dartmouth, Hartland, Kenton,
      Ugborough, and Plymtree, in Devonshire; in several places in
      Somersetshire, and at Charlton-on-Otmoor (erected in 1485) and
      Handborough, Oxfordshire. A very large number of the old screens remain,
      ornamented with the arms of Elizabeth or James I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proceeding eastward we enter the chancel, so called because it is inclosed
      with <i>cancelli</i>, or the lattice-work of the screen. If the church was
      formerly connected with some monastery we shall see some beautifully
      carved wooden stalls with rich canopies over them. The seats are curiously
      constructed. They can be turned up, and beneath the seats is a projecting
      bracket of wood, commonly adorned with carved work&mdash;animals, birds,
      leaves, and flowers, and often with grotesque, satirical, and irreverent
      devices. They are called miserere-stalls, and were used by the monks or
      canons to lean against during the portions of the long mediaeval services,
      when they were not allowed to be seated. As this practice was a concession
      to human weakness or infirmity, the seats were called in France <i>misericordes</i>,
      and in England <i>misereres</i>. The subjects of the sculptures are often
      extremely curious. Domestic scenes, fables, such as the &ldquo;Fox and the
      Grapes,&rdquo; demons carrying off monks, &ldquo;The Seven Deadly Sins,&rdquo;
      are some of these subjects. Miss Phipson has published a learned work on
      <i>Choir Stalls and their Carvings</i>, which contains reproductions of
      three hundred of her sketches of curiously wrought <i>misereres</i>.

      <br /> VILLAGE CHURCH IN THE VALE <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The lectern formerly stood in the chancel; and then, as now, was often in
      the form of a large eagle, emblematic of St. John. Most of these
      reading-desks belong to the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries, and are
      made of wood, latten, iron, or stone, as well as of brass. There is a very
      curious wooden one at East Hendred, Berks, representing a foot resting on
      the head of a dragon, emblematic of the word of God conquering the powers
      of evil. Ancient wooden double reading-desks are not uncommon. The
      ornamentation usually denotes the period when they were constructed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now we approach the high altar of the church, made of stone, covered
      with a beautifully worked frontal and cloth, and inclosed at the sides
      with curtains suspended on iron rods projecting from the wall. A crucifix
      hangs above the altar, and two candlesticks stand, one on each side. The
      furniture and accessories of the altar in pre-Reformation times were
      numerous. There was the pyx, a box or vessel of precious metal, in which
      the Host was reverently preserved for the purpose of giving communion to
      the sick and infirm. There were two small cruets or vessels for containing
      the wine and water used in Holy Communion, one engraved with the letter
      &ldquo;V&rdquo; (<i>vinum</i>), and the other &ldquo;A&rdquo; (<i>aqua</i>).
      An <i>osculatorium</i>, or pax tablet, of ivory or wood, overlaid with
      gold, was used for giving the kiss of peace during the High Mass just
      before the reception of the Host. Of church plate generally we shall write
      in a subsequent chapter.

      <br />NORMAN PISCINA, ROMSEY CHURCH, HANTS <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      On the south we see the piscina, which is contained in a beautifully
      carved niche&mdash;a hollow basin with a stone drain, wherein the priest
      washed his hands before consecrating the elements, and poured the water
      from the rinsed chalice. Above it in the niche was the credence, a shelf
      of stone, on which were placed the chalice and paten and all things
      necessary for the celebration. In some churches there is a separate
      credence table. On the north side was the aumbry, or locker, where the
      sacred vessels, altar linen, and service books were kept, guarded by a
      strong wooden door. The doors have usually disappeared, but a very large
      number of churches have the hole in the wall which was formerly the
      aumbry.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the south side are the sedilia, or stone seats, for the assistant
      clergy, frequently with canopies richly carved, and usually three in
      number. Opposite to the sedilia in the north wall is a large arch, within
      which the holy sepulchre was set up at Easter. This was a wooden structure
      made for the deposition of the consecrated elements of the Eucharist from
      the evening of Good Friday until the morning of Easter Day; during which
      time it was watched by a quasi-guard, after the manner of our Lord&rsquo;s
      sepulchre. The books of St. Lawrence, Reading, record:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Anno 1498. In primis payed for Wakyng of the Sepulchre viii'd."

"Anno 1510. It. payed to Walter Barton to the new Sepulchur iiii'li
xiii's x'd."
</pre>
    <p>
      As this sum of money was a considerable one at that period, the sepulchre
      must have been an object of unusual magnificence. Sometimes it was a
      permanent structure of stone, carved with figures of soldiers watching the
      tomb of our Lord. Behind the altar was the reredos. In village churches
      these screens were made up of recessed stone panels, surrounded by
      sculptured wallflowers and other devices; but in large churches they were
      very ornate, enriched with niches, statues, tabernacle-work, and other
      adornments. Many of them were destroyed at the Reformation, together with
      the stone altars. Some were covered up and concealed by plaster, in order
      to preserve them from iconoclastic violence. They were buried and
      forgotten, until by some happy accident their existence was revealed in
      modern times. Nearly all large churches, and some village churches,
      especially those connected with a monastery, had shrines, or receptacles
      for the body or relics of a saint. Some of them were fixed, and made of
      stone or wood, adorned with rich tabernacle-work, such as the shrine of
      St. Cuthbert at Durham, or of St. Frideswide at Oxford; and others were
      portable, shaped like coped boxes, covered with precious metal, enamels,
      and engraving. Sculptured stones in the walls of our churches often mark
      the spot in the building where relics were stored.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is evident from the existence of niches and piscinas in other parts of
      the church, besides in the south wall near the high altar, that there
      formerly existed many altars in the sacred building. At the east end of
      each aisle we usually find these indications of the existence of an altar,
      which belonged to a chantry chapel, separated from the rest of the church
      by a screen. Here a priest said Mass daily for the soul of the founder of
      the chantry, his ancestors, and posterity. Ancient stone altars still
      remain in some of our churches. Sometimes they have been removed from
      their place, and used as tombstones, or in paving the floor of the church.
      They can be recognised by the five crosses engraved on them, one at each
      corner, and one in the centre of the stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hagioscopes, or squints, are openings in the thickness of the wall,
      enabling worshippers in the chantry chapels to witness the elevation of
      the Host at the high altar. They are usually plain; but in some churches
      we find these curious apertures moulded and decorated with architectural
      designs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pre-Reformation churches had several wooden images of saints, most of
      which were destroyed by the iconoclastic zeal of the Reformers or
      Puritans. The brackets on which these figures stood often remain, though
      the images have disappeared.

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Low side windows, commonly called &ldquo;Lepers&rsquo; windows,&rdquo; are
      very frequently found in our churches, and usually on the south wall of
      the chancel. Their object has been, and is, much disputed among
      antiquaries. The vulgar idea is that poor lepers used to come to this
      window to see the celebration of the Mass; but unfortunately it is quite
      impossible in many cases to see the high altar through this window, and
      moreover lepers were not allowed to enter a churchyard. Another idea is
      that they were used as confessionals, the priest in the church hearing the
      confession of the penitent who knelt on the grass in the churchyard. A
      more inconvenient arrangement could not have been devised; and this idea
      might be at once dismissed, were it not that one of Henry&rsquo;s
      commissioners for suppressing monasteries and chantries wrote: &ldquo;We
      think it best that the place where these friars have been wont to hear
      outward confession of all-comers at certain times of the year, be walled
      up, and that use to be done for ever.&rdquo; It appears that sometimes at
      any rate the low side windows were used for this purpose. However, I am
      inclined to think that they were intended for the use of the anchorites or
      recluses, who dwelt in churches. The windows were not glazed, but had iron
      bars on the outside, and a wooden shutter on the inside of the church.
      These windows were probably their means of communication with the outside
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many village churches then, as now, had no vestry. Where a <i>vestiarium</i>
      existed it was usually on the north side of the chancel, and its contents
      were more elaborate than the plain surplice stole and hood of recent
      times. In the vestry press we should find an alb of fine white linen,
      somewhat similar to a surplice, ornamented with &ldquo;apparels,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>
      embroidery, on the cuffs and skirts; a girdle made of white silk
      embroidered with colours; an amice, or oblong piece of fine linen, worn on
      the head or as a collar; a stole with embroidered ends; a maniple, or
      strip of ornamented linen worn by the priest in his left hand during
      celebrations; dalmatic, chasuble and other vestments which the ornate
      ritual of the mediaeval church required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the Reformation the appearance of our churches was certainly
      splendid, and differed much from the Puritan simplicity of later times.
      The walls were covered with mural paintings. The windows, soon to be
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shorn of their glass of a thousand colourings,<br /> Through which
      the deepened glories once could enter,&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      were then resplendent with stained glass. Above, the rood looked down on
      all the worshippers. Everywhere there was beautifully carved woodwork,
      gilded and painted, tombs of knights and dames all painted and adorned,
      altars with rich embroidered hangings. The floor was composed of encaustic
      tiles, and had many memorial brasses. Armour, crests, and banners hung
      upon the walls. Lights burned before numerous images, and the whole
      appearance of our churches was gorgeous and magnificent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many changes have taken place since. Coatings of whitewash hide the mural
      paintings. Sacrilegious hands &ldquo;have broken down all the carved work
      with axes and hammers.&rdquo; The stone altars have disappeared, and
      instead we have &ldquo;an honest table decently covered.&rdquo;
      Reading-pews for the clergy were set up, and in the last century the
      hideous &ldquo;three decker,&rdquo; which hid the altar and utterly
      disfigured the sacred building. Instead of the low open seats great square
      high pews filled the nave. Hideous galleries were erected which obstructed
      the windows and hid the architectural beauties of former days. The old
      timber roofs were covered, and low flat ceilings substituted. Brasses were
      torn up and sold by dishonest churchwardens, and old monuments broken and
      defaced. The old stained-glass windows were destroyed. The Communion table
      was taken from the east end of the chancel, and seats erected round it.
      Crosses were defaced everywhere, and crucifixes destroyed. Puritan
      profanation and wanton destruction devastated our churches to a degree
      which has never been equalled since the hordes of heathens and barbaric
      Danish invaders carried fire and sword into the sanctuaries of God.

    <p>
      Much harm was done by the Goths and Vandals of the nineteenth century.
      Many old churches, replete with a thousand memories of the past, were
      pulled down entirely, and modern structures of &ldquo;Victorian Gothic&rdquo;
      style erected in their place, which can have none of the precious
      associations which the old churches had. Much harm was done to the old
      features of many churches by so-called &ldquo;restoration,&rdquo; carried
      out by men ignorant of architecture and antiquities. But we are learning
      better now. The Society of Antiquaries has done much to prevent
      injudicious restoration and the destruction of our old churches, and if
      any incumbent and his parishioners are thinking of restoring their church,
      they cannot do better than to consult the secretaries of that learned
      body, who will show how best to preserve the interesting memorials of the
      past which time has spared.

    </p>
    <p>
      We have already mourned over the wanton destruction of much that was of
      intense interest and value in our churches; but the most systematic
      robbery and spoliation of our church goods at the time of the Reformation
      were carried out in the matter of church plate. Henry VIII. stripped our
      cathedrals and conventual churches of almost all that was valuable, and
      the unscrupulous commissioners of Edward VI. performed a like office for
      our parish churches and chantries. A large number of the old chalices were
      also melted down and converted into Communion cupsduring the reigns of
      Edward VI. and Elizabeth. Hence of all the vast store of church plate
      which our churches possessed before the Reformation, at the present time
      throughout all England only thirty-four chalices and seventy-three patens
      remain. It is true that not all the ancient vessels fell into the hands of
      the commissioners of the king. In the churchwardens&rsquo; account books
      of the period we read of sundry sales of church plate. Evidently the
      parishioners had some presentiment of the coming spoliation; so they sold
      their valuables, and kept the proceeds of the sale for &ldquo;the paving
      of the streets,&rdquo; or other parochial necessities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ancient inventories of church goods show the deplorable loss of the
      valuables of the church which has taken place. Thus at the church of St.
      Lawrence, Reading, in the year 1517, the inventory tells us of the
      following: a cross of silver and gilt; a censer of silver gilt; another
      censer; a ship of silver for holding incense; another ship of silver; two
      candlesticks of silver; two books bound in silver; two basins of silver; a
      pyx of silver gilt, with a silver pin; a monstrance of silver gilt; a
      silver gilt chrismatory for the holy oil; a pax; two cruets; a bell; a
      chalice, with a crucifix enamelled on the foot and the Trinity on the
      paten; another chalice, with a crucifix engraved on the foot and a hand on
      the paten; another chalice similarly described; another similar to first
      chalice; and two others, with a crucifix on the foot and a vernicle, or <i>vera
      icon</i> (a representation of our Lord&rsquo;s face miraculously
      delineated on the napkin of St. Veronica). All these vessels were made of
      silver or silver gilt. Nor were these all the treasures. There were
      several reliquaries of silver gilt containing parts of the holy cross; a
      gridiron, with a bone of St. Lawrence, and other articles contained in
      silver boxes; and many books bound with silver clasps. The total weight of
      silver in this church amounted to seven hundred ounces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Village churches were, of course, less sumptuously furnished than this
      important town church, which being situated under the shadow of one of the
      largest and most important abbeys in the kingdom, would receive many
      costly gifts and benefactors. But the inventories of village churches show
      that there was no lack of plate, rich altar hangings, copes, and
      vestments, which helped to swell the goodly heap of spoil. In country
      churches in Oxfordshire there were silver chalices and patens, pyxes,
      censers, candlesticks, chrismatories, crosses, sanctus bells, and other
      articles of plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the practice in mediaeval times to place in the coffin of a bishop
      a chalice and paten; hence some of the earliest specimens of church plate
      which we possess have been recovered from episcopal graves.[<a
      href="#linkb3">3</a>] The Rites of Durham enjoin that on the death of a
      bishop he was to be buried &ldquo;with a little chalice of silver, other
      metal, or wax&rdquo; aid upon his breast within the coffin.[<a
      href="#linkb4">4</a>] Most of these were made of pewter or lead, but some
      have been found of silver gilt, latten, and tin. It is perhaps scarcely
      necessary for our present purposes to describe these early specimens of
      sacred vessels, as the number of them is so limited; and few of my readers
      will be able to discover any mediaeval examples amongst the plate of their
      own church. However, I will point out a few peculiarities of the plate of
      each period.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earliest chalice, used in the church of Berwick St. James, Wilts,
      until a few years ago, and now in the British Museum, dates from the
      beginning of the thirteenth century. Its bowl is broad and shallow, the
      stem and knot (by which the vessel was held) and foot being plain and
      circular. Then the makers (from 1250 to 1275) fashioned the stem and knot
      separately from the bowl and foot, and shaped them polygonally. During the
      remaining years of the century the foot was worked into ornate lobes. Then
      the bowl is deepened and made more conical. About 1350 the custom arose of
      laying the chalice on its side on the paten to drain at the ablutions at
      Mass; and as the round-footed chalices would have a tendency to roll, the
      foot was made hexagonal for stability. Henceforth all the mediaeval
      chalices were fashioned with a six-sided foot. By degrees the bowl became
      broader and shallower, and instead of the base having six points, its form
      is a sexfoil without any points. Several old chalices are engraved with
      the inscription&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Calicem salutaris accipiam et nomen Domini inbocabo.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link223" id="link223"></a><br /> <br /><br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig">
      <img alt="223.jpg (15K)" src="images/223.jpg" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of the compartments of the base there was a representation of a
      crucifix, or the Virgin, or ihc, or xpc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The usual devices on ancient patens were the <i>Manus Dei</i>, or hand of
      God, in the act of blessing; on later ones the vernicle, or face of our
      Lord; the Holy Trinity; the Holy Lamb; the sacred monogram. The oldest
      paten in existence is that found at Chichester Cathedral in a coffin, and
      its date is about the year 1180. In the centre is a rude engraving of the
      <i>Agnus Dei</i>, and it bears the inscription&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Agnus Dei qui tollis pecata mundi miserere nobis.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link224" id="link224"></a><br /> <br /><br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig">
      <img alt="224.jpg (33K)" src="images/224.jpg" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The grave of Bishop Grostete at Lincoln yielded up an ancient paten
      (1230-53), which has the figure of a bishop vested, the right hand raised
      in the act of blessing, the left holding a crozier. The oldest piece of
      church plate still in use is a remarkable paten at Wyke Church, near
      Winchester, the date of which is about 1280. It bears an engraving of the
      <i>Agnus Dei</i> holding a banner, and around the rim is the legend&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CUNTA: CREO: VIRTUTE: REGO: PIETATE REFORMO.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another favourite inscription was <i>Benedicamus patrem et filium cum
      spiritu sancto</i>; but on the paten in the church of Great Waltham,
      Essex, the important word <i>spiritu</i> is omitted for want of room.

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      We have already mentioned several of the important pieces of church plate
      which were in use in mediaeval times. Censers, or thuribles, were common
      in all our ancient parish churches, sometimes of gold or silver, more
      usually of brass or latten, and were in the shape of a covered vase or
      cup, perforated so as to allow the fumes of burning incense to escape.
      Most of our English censers are now in museums, but several ancient ones
      are still in use in the private chapels of Roman Catholic families.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old inventories always mention a pyx, a box or vessel of gold or silver,
      in which the Host was reserved for the sick and infirm. It often resembles
      a chalice, except that instead of the bowl there is a covered receptacle
      for the Host. A beautiful specimen was dug up a few years ago in the
      churchyard of Yateley, Hants. Another vessel was the monstrance, in which
      the Blessed Sacrament was carried in procession, and exposed on the altar.
      The form varied. Sometimes monstrances were made in the shape of a tower,
      or a covered chalice; sometimes in the form of images carrying silver
      pyxes, elaborately ornamented with many jewels. Processions were always a
      great feature of mediaeval worship; hence the monstrance was frequently in
      use, especially on such occasions as the celebrations of Corpus Christi
      Day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holy oil was much used in the services, as in the Roman Catholic Church at
      the present time. It was blessed by a bishop on Maundy Thursday, and used
      in Baptism, Confirmation, and Extreme Unction, as well as at the
      Consecration of Churches, Ordination, and the Coronation of Kings. The
      vessel for holding the oil was an important piece of church plate, and was
      called a chrismatory. Usually there were three distinct vessels, one for
      holding the oil for the sick, a second for use at confirmations, and a
      third for the baptismal oil. Sometimes these vessels are labelled with the
      words EXT. UNC., CAT., and CHR., according to the recommendation of St.
      Charles Borromeo, in order that each oil might be kept for its proper use,
      and that no confusion might arise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pax was a small tablet of silver or other precious metal, used for
      giving the kiss of peace during High Mass. The celebrant kissed the
      tablet, and held it aloft before all the people. It was usually adorned
      with a representation of the <i>Agnus Dei</i>. Of the cruets containing
      wine and water for the celebration we have already written. Then there was
      a sacring bell, often made of silver, which was rung during the service at
      the time of the elevation of the Host, and at the sound the congregation
      knelt.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have now examined the aumbry, and noted its contents, upon which the
      commissioners in the reign of Edward VI. made such shameful inroads.
      Henceforth the plate was confined to a chalice and paten, alms-dish, and
      usually a large silver flagon. The form of the chalice was entirely
      changed. As we have noticed, the bowl of the pre-Reformation chalices
      became smaller and shallower, on account of the gradually introduced
      practice of refusing the wine to the laity. Now in the year 1562 the size
      of the bowl was greatly enlarged, and the &ldquo;Communion cup&rdquo; took
      the place of the &ldquo;Massing chalice.&rdquo; Some poor parishes were
      obliged to content themselves with pewter vessels. St. Lawrence&rsquo;s
      Church, Reading, had a curious bridal cup, which was carried before all
      brides who were married in that church. The custom of drinking wine in the
      church at marriages is enjoined in the Hereford Missal, and the Sarum
      Missal ordered that the bread immersed in the wine, and consumed by the
      company, should first be blessed by the priest. Some of these
      post-Reformation vessels are extremely interesting. They record the
      thankofferings of pious donors on the occasion of some great event in the
      national annals, such as the Restoration, or of some private mercy
      vouchsafed to the individual. They record the connection of some family
      with the parish, the arms they bore; and the Hall marks tell us of their
      date, which is often anterior to the date of the inscription.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hall marks were first introduced in 1300 by Edward I. in order to keep up
      the purity of silver, and consisted of the lion&rsquo;s or leopard&rsquo;s
      head crowned. This was called the king&rsquo;s mark. The maker&rsquo;s
      mark was introduced in 1363, and was some initial or badge chosen by the
      silversmith. To these were added in 1438 the year letter or assayer&rsquo;s
      mark, a different letter being chosen for each year. When the alphabet was
      exhausted, another with differently shaped letters was begun. In 1545 the
      lion passant was introduced, and since 1784 the portrait of the reigning
      sovereign has appeared. With the assistance of Mr. Cripps&rsquo; <i>Old
      English Plate</i>, which contains a list of the alphabets used in marking
      plate, it is not very difficult to discover the date of any piece of
      silver. Inventories of church plate are being made in many counties and
      dioceses, and no more useful work can be undertaken by our local
      antiquarian societies.

    </p>
    <p>
      The pious care which we all love to bestow on the mortal remains of our
      nearest and dearest, and the respect and honour with which all men regard
      the bodies of departed heroes, kings, saints, and warriors, have produced
      a remarkable series of sepulchral monuments, examples of which may be
      found everywhere. The cairns and tumuli of the primitive races which
      inhabited our island were the results of the same feelings of reverent
      regard which inspired the beautifully carved mediaeval monuments, the
      memorial brass, or the cross-shaped tombstone of to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have already mentioned the cromlechs and barrows and other memorials of
      the early inhabitants of Britain. We have seen the cists of Saxon times,
      the coffins formed of several stones placed together in the form of a
      table. The Normans introduced stone coffins for the sepulchre of their
      great men, many of which may be seen in our cathedrals and old conventual
      churches. On the lids of their coffins they frequently cut a single cross.
      When the style of architecture changed to that of the Early English and
      Decorated periods, monumental slabs were ornamented with much greater
      richness and elaboration, and inscriptions were added, and also some
      device which showed the trade, rank, or profession of the departed. Thus
      the chalice and paten denoted a priest; a sword showed the knight; an axe,
      a forester; an ink-horn, a notary; shears, a wool merchant.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the beginning of the thirteenth century it occurred to someone to
      preserve the likeness of his departed friend as well as the symbols of his
      rank and station. So effigies were introduced upon the surface of the
      slabs, and were carved flat; but ere fifty years had passed away the art
      of the sculptor produced magnificent monumental effigies. Knights and
      nobles lie clad in armour with their ladies by their sides. Bishops and
      abbots bless the spectators with their uplifted right hands. Judges lie in
      their official garb, and merchants with the emblems of their trade. At
      their feet lie animals, usually having some heraldic connection with the
      deceased, or symbolical of his work&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> a dragon is trodden
      down beneath the feet of a bishop, signifying the defeat of sin as the
      result of his ministry. The heads of effigies usually rest on cushions,
      which are sometimes supported by two angels.
    </p>
    <p>
      A peculiar characteristic of the military effigies in England is that the
      knights are often represented with the legs crossed. Many speculations
      have been made with regard to the meaning of this fashion of cross-legged
      effigy. It is a popular superstition, in which for some years the writer
      shared, that such effigies represented Crusaders. We were told in our
      young days that when the knight had his legs crossed at the feet he had
      gone to the Crusades once; when at the knees, that he had been to two
      Crusades; and when crossed at the thighs, he had been thrice to rescue the
      Holy City from the hands of the infidels. All this seemed very plausible
      and interesting, but it is undoubtedly a myth. Many known Crusaders have
      their effigies with uncrossed legs, and many who never went to the
      Crusades have cross-legged effigies. Moreover, there are no such monuments
      in any foreign country which swelled the army of Crusaders. Hence we must
      abandon the pleasing superstition, and reconcile ourselves to the fact
      that no particular signification can be assigned to these cross-legged
      effigies, and that only fashion prompted the mediaeval sculptors to adopt
      this attitude for their figures. This mode prevailed until about the year
      1320.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the close of the fifteenth century the art of making monumental
      effigies degenerated together with the skill of the architects of that
      period. We see the husband and wife kneeling facing each other, with a
      faldstool before each figure. A company of small figures below the
      effigies represent the children, the boys on one side, the girls on the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early wooden effigies were also in use. There is one much battered by the
      careless hands of former generations of villagers in the rural church of
      my parish of Barkham. The artists often used much colour, gilding, and
      enamel in making these effigies; and often rich canopies were erected over
      them, containing fine tabernacle-work and figures of saints in niches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another form of effigy was commonly in use, in addition to the figures
      just described. These are called incised effigies, which were cut in
      outline upon flat slabs of stone, the lines being filled in with enamelled
      metals. Thorton Abbey, Lincolnshire, and Brading, in the Isle of Wight,
      have examples of this work. But the great expense of these enamels, and
      also their frailty when exposed in the pavements of churches, led to the
      use of brass; and hence arose the introduction of memorial brasses for
      which our country is famous.
    </p>
    <p>
      We owe the application of brass to memorial tablets to the artists of
      Flanders, and the date of their introduction is about the middle of the
      thirteenth century. The execution of almost all of our English brasses is
      due to native artists. Foreign brasses are usually of great size, and
      consist of a quadrangular sheet of metal, on which is engraved the figure,
      usually under a canopy, the background being ornamented with rich diaper,
      foliage, or scrollwork, and the incisions filled with colouring. Several
      brasses in England conform to this style of workmanship, and are evidently
      the production of foreign artists. The English brasses, on the contrary,
      consist of separate pieces, with an irregular outline, corresponding with
      that of the figure. They have no brass background; and for delicacy of
      engraving and general appearance the English brasses are by far the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      The names of the makers of brasses have been almost entirely lost. Two
      only bear marks which are supposed to be those of the engraver. No other
      country can boast of so large a number of these memorials as England, in
      spite of the hard usage they have received and their wanton destruction.
      About four thousand remain; and constantly we find the matrices cut in
      stone slabs, from which brasses have been torn; so that we may assume that
      quite as many have been destroyed as those which survive. The southern and
      eastern counties are most richly furnished with these monuments, whereas
      the western and northern counties have but few brasses. Norfolk, Suffolk,
      Essex, and Kent are the most rich in this respect. The earliest brass of
      which we have any record is that of Simon de Beauchamp, who died before
      1208. This is mentioned by Leland. The earliest brass now in existence is
      that of Sir John D&rsquo;Aubernown at Stoke Dabernon, Surrey, which was
      fashioned in 1277. In the fourteenth century a very large number of
      brasses, remarkable for their beauty of form and execution, were made. The
      artistic workmanship began to decline in the fifteenth century, and in the
      following became utterly degenerate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not an uncommon practice for subsequent generations to appropriate
      the memorials of their predecessors. Such brasses are called palimpsests.
      By the carelessness of churchwardens, by fraud, or spoliation, brasses
      were taken from the churches, and acquired by some maker in the town. When
      a new one was required, the tradesman would take from his stock, and on
      the reverse engrave the figure of the individual whose memory he was
      called upon to perpetuate. Hence when brasses are taken up from the
      pavements, frequently the remains of a much earlier memorial are found on
      the reverse side. There is an example of this curious method of procedure
      at St. Lawrence&rsquo;s Church, Reading, where on the reverse of a brass
      to the memory of Walter Barton was found the remains of the brass of Sir
      John Popham, who was buried at the Charterhouse, London. This monastery
      was dissolved in 1536, the monuments sold, Sir John Popham&rsquo;s brass
      among them, which was evidently soon converted into a memorial of Walter
      Barton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes the original brass was appropriated as it lay, the figure being
      slightly altered to suit the style of costume prevalent at the later date.
      In other cases the engraver did not even trouble himself to alter the
      figure, and simply added a new inscription and shield of arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wanton destruction and gross neglect of churchwardens, both before and
      after the Reformation, were very great. At St. Mary&rsquo;s Church,
      Reading, the accounts tell a sad tale of the disgraceful damage in the
      year 1547:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Receyvid of John Saunders for iii cwt lacking ix&rsquo;li of metall
      that was taken upp of the graves, and of olde candlestycks at vi&rsquo;s
      the hundred xlvj&rsquo;s ii&rsquo;d.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently a clean sweep was made of most of the memorial brasses in the
      church, and few escaped destruction. The tale is too familiar. Most
      churches have suffered in the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The study of brasses throws much light upon the costumes and fashions of
      the day when they were engraved. We see priests, who may be recognised by
      the tonsure and vestments, amongst which we find the alb, amice, stole,
      maniple, and chasuble. The pastoral staff, ring, mitre, sandals, tunic,
      dalmatic, and gloves mark the graves of bishops and mitred abbots.
    </p>
    <p>
      A close skull-cap, a long robe with narrow sleeves, a hood, tippet, and
      mantle buttoned on the right shoulder, compose the dress of judges and
      officers of the law, as depicted on brasses. The changes in the fashion
      and style of armour, which took place between the fourteenth and the
      seventeenth centuries, are all accurately represented in these memorials;
      and also the picturesque costumes of ladies with their curious headgear;
      and the no less various fashions of the male civilian&rsquo;s dress. A
      study of brasses is an admirable guide to the prevailing style of dress
      during the periods of their construction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beautiful canopies over the heads of the figures are well worthy of
      attention, and also the inscriptions. These usually take the form of Latin
      verses; and although many were written by learned abbots and scholars, the
      classical knowledge displayed is somewhat faulty. Here are a few examples:&mdash;

          </p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      Sometimes the author of the inscription recorded his name, as did the
      learned Dame Elizabeth Hobby on a brass at Shottesbrooke, which runs&mdash;
    </p>
    <table summary="poems">

    <p>
      Variety was added sometimes by jumbling together various languages,
      Norman-French, Latin, and English being often oddly combined.
    </p>
    <p>
      People in the Middle Ages loved punning and playing upon the sound of
      words. Thus a brass to the memory of Thomas Hylle (or Hill) has some
      verses beginning &ldquo;<i>Mons</i> in valle jacet.&rdquo; John Day, the
      printer, had a very extravagant and jocular epitaph beginning&mdash;
    </p>
    <table summary="poems">

        <td>

      </tr>

      alluding to his publication of Foxe&rsquo;s <i>Book of Martyrs</i>. His
      widow probably married a man named Stone. Hence we read&mdash;

    </table>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Orate pro anima,&rdquo; or &ldquo;of your charite pray for the soul
      of &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; were usual inscriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is somewhat difficult for the unpractised eye to read inscriptions on
      brasses, owing to the contractions and omissions of letters. Thus <i>m</i>
      and <i>n</i> are often omitted, and a line is placed over the adjoining
      letter to indicate the omission. Thus a=ia stands for <i>anima</i>, leg=u
      for <i>legum</i>. The letter <i>r</i> is also left out. Z stands for <i>que</i>,
      and there are many other contractions, such as D=ns for <i>Dominus</i>,
      D=s for <i>Deus</i>, E=ps for <i>Episcopus</i>, g=ia for <i>gratia</i>,
      m=ia for <i>misericordia</i>, and many others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The study of the emblems and devices is full of interest. Of
      ecclesiastical emblems we have the symbols of the Holy Trinity&mdash;God
      the Father represented as an aged person, holding a crucifix on which the
      dove, an emblem of the Holy Spirit, is alighting&mdash;representations of
      our Lord, angels, saints,[<a href="#linkb5">5</a>] evangelists, the fylfot
      cross, roses, and figures of Death. Sometimes the figure on the brass
      holds a heart in his hand, which indicates a response on the part of the
      deceased to the old invitatory &ldquo;Sursum corda.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The armorial bearings of the deceased are usually represented on brasses,
      and also personal or professional devices. The founders of churches hold
      representations in miniature of the churches which they founded. Bishops
      and abbots have a pastoral staff; priests, a chalice, or a book; wool
      merchants have woolpacks beneath their feet, and other tradesmen have
      similar devices denoting their special calling. Merchants&rsquo; marks
      also frequently appear; and the mediaeval taste for punning is shown by
      frequent rebuses formed on the names of the deceased, <i>e.g.</i> a
      peacock, for one named Pecok; a fox, for a Foxley; four tuns and a cross,
      for Master Croston.
    </p>
    <p>
      England may well be proud of the brass memorials of her worthy sons and
      daughters. It is, however, terribly sad to see the destruction which
      fanatical and greedy folk have wrought on these beautiful monuments. As we
      have already noticed, the spoliators of the Reformation period
      accomplished much wanton destruction, and removed tombs &ldquo;for
      greedinesse of the brasse.&rdquo; Cromwell&rsquo;s soldiers and
      commissioners did a vast deal more damage, violating sepulchres and
      monuments, and destroying brasses everywhere. A third cause of the
      defacement and loss of these valuable memorials has been the gross
      carelessness of churchwardens and incumbents, who during any alterations
      or restoration of their churches have allowed them to be sold, destroyed,
      or appropriated by the builders. Truly we have entered upon a diminished
      inheritance. It behoves us to preserve with the utmost vigilance and care
      the memorials which fanaticism, greed, and carelessness have spared.

    </p>
    <p>
      The parish chest in the vestry usually contains many documents, which are
      of profound interest to the student of village antiquities. It contains
      the old churchwardens&rsquo; account books, the parish registers, lists of
      briefs, and often many other papers and records which bear on the history
      of the parish. The old register books record the names of past generations
      of villagers, and many curious facts about the parish and its people,
      which are not found in the dull dry columns of our modern books.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parish registers were first ordered by Thomas Cromwell in the year 1538,
      and from that date many of our registers begin.[<a href="#linkb6">6</a>]
      But all vicars did not obey the injunctions of Viceregent Cromwell; they
      were renewed by Edward VI. in 1547 and by Queen Elizabeth in 1559, and
      most of our old register books begin with this date. James I. ordered that
      the registers should be written over again in a parchment book, the
      entries previously having been recorded on paper. Hence many of our books,
      although they begin with the year 1538, are really copies of the paper
      records made previous to 1603.
    </p>
    <p>
      The disturbances of the Civil War period caused much neglect in the
      keeping of the registers. The incumbent was often driven away from his
      flock, and parish registrars were chosen by the parishioners and approved
      and sworn before a justice of the peace. Here is a record of this business
      taken from the books of this parish:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whereas Robtr Williams of the prish of Barkham in the County of
      Berks was elected and chosen by the inhabitants of the same prish to be
      there prish Register, he therefore ye sd Ro: Wms was approved and sworne
      this sixteenth day of November 1653. Ri: Bigg, J.P.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Henceforth the children are registered as having been <i>born</i>, not <i>baptised</i>,
      until the Restoration brought back the clergyman to his flock again, and
      the entries are written in a scholarly hand, and the disorder of the
      previous years ceases.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1679 an Act was passed requiring that the dead should be buried in
      woollen, the purpose being to lessen &ldquo;the importation of linen from
      beyond the seas, and the encouragement of the woollen and paper
      manufacturers of this kingdom.&rdquo; A penalty of &pound;5 was inflicted
      for a violation of this Act; and as frequently people preferred to be
      buried in linen, a record of the fine appears&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> at Gayton,
      Northamptonshire, where we find in the register&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;1708. Mrs. Dorothy Bellingham was buryed April 5, in <i>Linnen</i>,
      and the forfeiture of the Act payd fifty shillings to ye informer and
      fifty shillings to ye poor of the parishe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pope wrote the following lines on the burial of Mrs. Oldfield, the
      actress, with reference to this custom:&mdash;
    </p>
    <table summary="poems">

      Sometimes after the name in the register is added the words, &ldquo;Not
      worth &pound;600.&rdquo; This refers to the Act of William III. in 1694,
      which required that all persons baptised, married, or buried, having an
      estate of that value, should pay a tax of twenty shillings. The money was
      required for carrying on the war with France, and the Act was in force for
      five years. This description of the personal estate was not intended to be
      invidious, but was of practical utility in enforcing the Act.

      The parish registers reflect with wonderful accuracy the life of the
      people, and are most valuable to the student of history. Clergymen took
      great pride in recording &ldquo;the short and simple annals of the poor.&rdquo;
      A Gloucestershire rector (1630 A.D.) wrote in his book the following good
      advice which might with advantage be taken in many other villages:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will have this Book last, bee sure to aire it att the fier,
      or in the Sunne, three or four times a yeare&mdash;els it will grow
      dankish and rott, therefore look to it. It will not be amisse when you
      find it dankish to wipe over the leaves with a dry wollen cloth. This
      Place is very much subject to dankishness; therefore I say looke to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A study of the curious entries which we occasionally find conveys much
      remarkable information. Sometimes, in the days of astrology, in order to
      assist in casting the nativity, it is recorded that at the time of the
      child&rsquo;s birth &ldquo;the sun was in Libra,&rdquo; or &ldquo;in
      Taurus.&rdquo; Gipsies were evidently numerous in the sixteenth century,
      as we constantly find references to &ldquo;the roguish AEgyptians.&rdquo;
      The domestic jester finds his record in the entry: &ldquo;1580. March 21,
      William, fool to my Lady Jerningham.&rdquo; The suicide is &ldquo;infamously
      buried.&rdquo; Heart-burial is often recorded, as at Wooburn, Bucks:
      &ldquo;1700. Cadaver Edi Thomas, equitis aurati, hic inhumatum fuit
      vicessimo tertio die Junii.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Records of the visitations of the plague are very numerous in all parts of
      England, as at Egglescliffe, Durham: &ldquo;1644. In this year there died
      of the plague in this towne one and twenty people; they are not all buried
      in the churchyard, and are not in the Register.&rdquo; Sometimes masses of
      human bones are found buried in fields outside towns and villages,
      memorials of this devastating plague.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parish clerks have not always had very musical voices when they shout out
      the &ldquo;Amens.&rdquo; The Rector of Buxted, Sussex (1666 A.D.), records
      with a sigh of relief the death of his old clerk, &ldquo;whose melody
      warbled forth as if he had been thumped on the back with a stone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes royal visits to the neighbourhood are recorded, even a royal
      hunt, as when James I. hunted the hare at Fordham, Cambridgeshire. The
      register of Wolverton gives &ldquo;a license for eating flesh on
      prohibited days granted to Sir Tho. Temple, on paying 13s. 4d.&rdquo;
      Storms, earthquakes, and floods are described; and records of certificates
      granted to persons to go before the king to be touched for the disease
      called the king&rsquo;s evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Civil War is frequently mentioned, and also caused the omission of
      many entries. At Tarporley, Cheshire, there is a break from 1643 to 1648,
      for which the rector thus accounts:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This intermission hapned by reason of the great wars obliterating
      memorials, wasting fortunes, and slaughtering persons of all sorts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Parish registers have fared ill and suffered much from the gross
      carelessness of their custodians. We read of the early books of Christ
      Church, Hants, being converted into kettle-holders by the curate&rsquo;s
      wife. Many have been sold as waste paper, pages ruthlessly cut out, and
      village schoolbooks covered with the leaves of old registers. The
      historian of Leicestershire writes of the register of Scraptoft:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has not been a plaything for young pointers&mdash;it has not
      occupied a bacon scratch, or a bread and cheese cupboard&mdash;it has not
      been scribbled on within and without; but it has been treasured ever since
      1538, to the honour of a succession of worthy clergymen.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>O
      si sic omnes</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      The churchwardens&rsquo; account books are even of greater value to the
      student of history than the registers, priceless as the latter are for
      genealogical purposes. The Bishop of Oxford states that &ldquo;in the old
      account books and minute books of the churchwardens in town and country we
      possess a very large but very perishable and rapidly perishing treasury of
      information on matters the very remembrance of which is passing away,
      although their practical bearing on the development of the system of local
      government is indisputable, and is occasionally brought conspicuously
      before the eye of the people by quaint survivals.... It is well that such
      materials for the illustration of this economic history as have real value
      should be preserved in print; and that the customs which they illustrate
      should be reclaimed by History from the misty region of folklore, whilst
      they can.&rdquo; Many of these account books date from pre-Reformation
      times, and disclose the changes which took place in the fabric of our
      churches, the removal of roods and other ecclesiastical furniture, during
      the Reformation. They are usually kept with great exactness, and contain
      an accurate record of the receipts and expenditure for each year. Some of
      the entries are very curious, and relate to the sports and pastimes of our
      ancestors, the mystery plays, and church ales, which were all under the
      patronage of the churchwardens. The proceeds of these entertainments were
      devoted to the maintenance of the church, and were included in the
      accounts, as well as the necessary cost of the merry diversions. Thus in
      the books of St. Lawrence&rsquo;s Church, Reading, we find such items as
      the following:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                                  s. d.
"1499. Paid for a coat for Robin Hood             5  4
         "  for a supper to Robin Hood and
               his company                        1  6
         "  for making the church clean
               against the day of drinking
               in the said church                    4"

"1531. Paid for five ells of canvass for a coat
            for Maid Marian                       1  6-1/4"
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bells for the Morris dancers,&rdquo; &ldquo;liveries and coats,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;bread and ale,&rdquo; &ldquo;horse-meat of the horses for the kings
      of Colen on May Day,&rdquo; are some of the items which appear in these
      books.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another book tells us about the &ldquo;Gatherings&rdquo; at Hock-tide,
      when on one day the men stopped the women, and on the next the women the
      men, and refused to let them go until they gave money. The women always
      succeeded in collecting the most money.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                                  s. d.
"It'm.  receyved of the men's gatherynge          7  3
   "       "       "    women's gatherynge       37  5"
</pre>
    <p>
      Traces of this custom are still found in many country places. The practice
      of &ldquo;hocking&rdquo; at Hungerford and &ldquo;lifting&rdquo; in
      Lancashire subsist still, but the money collected is no longer devoted to
      any pious uses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The item &ldquo;Paschall money at Easter&rdquo; frequently occurs. This
      was originally a collection for the Paschal taper, which burned before the
      high altar at Eastertide. When, in the reign of Elizabeth, the taper was
      no longer used, the money was devoted to buying the bread and the wine for
      the Easter Communion. Another item which often appears is a payment of
      &ldquo;Smoke farthings&rdquo; to the bishop of the diocese at his
      Visitation Court. This is another name for Peter&rsquo;s pence, formerly
      given to the Pope. In the accounts of Minchinhampton we find the entry
      under the year 1576: &ldquo;For Pentecost money, otherwyse peter pence,
      sometyme payed to Antecryst of Rome xvi&rsquo;d.&rdquo; After the
      Reformation the tax was collected, but given to the bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are very many other points of interest which a study of the
      churchwardens&rsquo; books presents. In more recent times we find constant
      payments for the slaughter of sparrows, and many other items which
      scarcely come under the head of ecclesiastical charges.[<a href="#linkb7">7</a>]
      But of course the vestry was then the council chamber of the parish, which
      managed all the temporal affairs of the village community. Possibly, in
      these days of Poor Law Unions, District and County Councils, our affairs
      may be managed better; but there is much to be said in favour of the older
      system, and Parish Councils are not much of an improvement on the old
      vestries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another book which our parish chest contains is the Brief Book. Briefs
      were royal letters which were sent to the clergy directing that
      collections be made for certain objects. These were very numerous and
      varied. The building of St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral after the Great Fire, a
      fire at Drury Lane Theatre, rebuilding of churches, the redemption of
      English slaves taken by pirates, the construction of harbours in Scotland,
      losses by hail, floods, French refugees, Reformed Episcopal churches in
      Great Poland and Polish Prussia, Protestants in Copenhagen, loss by fire,
      colleges in Philadelphia&mdash;these and many other objects were commended
      to the liberality of Churchmen. The sums collected were usually very
      small, and Pepys wrote in his <i>Diary</i>, June 30th, 1661:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To church, when we observe the trade of briefs is come now up to so
      constant a course every Sunday that we resolve to give no more to them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The granting of briefs gave rise to much abuse, and they were finally
      abolished by the advice of Lord Palmerston.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contents of the parish chest afford an unlimited mass of material for
      those who love to study the curious customs of our forefathers and their
      strange usages. Here is a record of a much-married person:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary Blewitt, ye wife of nine husbands successively, buried eight
      of ym, but last of all ye woman dy&rsquo;d and was buried, May 7th 1681.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the margin of the register is written, &ldquo;This was her funeral
      text.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The register of Sparsholt, Berks, records an instance of the body of a
      dead man being arrested for debt. The entry is:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The corpse of John Matthews, of Fawler, was stopt on the churchway
      for debt, August 27, 1689. And having laine there fower days, was by
      Justices warrant buryied in the place to prevent annoyances&mdash;but
      about sixe weekes after it was by an order of Sessions taken up and buried
      in the churchyard by the wife of the deceased.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A dog-whipper was an ancient parish official, whose duty was to drive out
      all dogs from the church. The Wakefield accounts contain the items:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"1616. Paid to Gorby Stork for whippinge          s. d.
    doggs                                         2  6"

"1703. For hatts shoes and hoses for sexton
    and dog-whipper                              18  6"
</pre>
    <p>
      Another official was the person appointed to arouse members of the
      congregation from their slumbers during divine service. The parish
      accounts of Castleton record:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                                  s. d.
"1702. Paid to sluggard waker                    10  0"
</pre>
    <p>
      Sometimes the cost of a journey to London was defrayed by the parish in
      order to enable a sufferer to be touched for the king&rsquo;s evil. The
      Ecclesfield accounts contain the following entry relating to this custom:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"1641. Given to John Parkin wife towards her
    travell to London to get cure of his Majestie
    for the disease called the Evill, which her   s. d.
    Sonen Thorn is visited withall                6  8"
</pre>
    <p>
      The clergymen were required to keep a register of all who were so touched,
      in order that they might not again go to the king and receive the bounty
      which accompanied the touch. Hence we read in the register of Hambleden,
      Bucks:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"1685. May 17, Mary Wallington had a certificate to goe before the King
for a disease called the King's Evil."
</pre>
    <p>
      The treating of bishops and clergy is often noticed in the accounts.
      Sometimes a sugar-loaf was presented, as at St. James&rsquo;, Bristol:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"1629. Paid for a sugar loaf for the Lord Bishop 15's 10'd"
</pre>
    <p>
      Sometimes items relate to their refreshment:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"1593. Pd for a galland of beer given to the
    Beishopp of Hereford                            iiii'd"

"1617. Pd for a quart of wine and sugar bestowed
    upon two preachers                                 x'd"
</pre>
    <p>
      The status of students at the Universities was not so high in former days
      as at present, and poor scholars used to beg their way to Oxford and
      Cambridge, and receive the assistance of the charitable. Hence we read in
      the Leverton accounts:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"1562. Gave to a pore scholar at Oxford.            2s. 0d."
</pre>
    <p>
      With this record of &ldquo;a pore scholar&rdquo; we must leave our study
      of the contents of the parish chest, which afford such valuable and
      accurate information about village and town life of ancient times.

      STAINED GLASS, TILES, AND MURAL PAINTINGS

    </p>
    <p>
      No branch of archaeology is more interesting than the study of our
      stained-glass windows, which illustrate so clearly the faith, history, and
      customs of our ancestors. We have again to thank the fanatics of the
      Reformation and Cromwellian periods for the shameful destruction of so
      many beautiful windows. How great has been the loss to art and history
      caused by their reckless demolition! And in addition to this miserable
      violence our windows have suffered greatly from the ignorant indifference
      of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, which allowed priceless
      examples of old glass to be removed and replaced by the hideous specimens
      of the modern glass-painters.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Saxon times this art found a home in England, the <i>artifices
      lapidearum et vitrearum fenestrarum</i> having been invited to this
      country by Wilfrid, Bishop of York, in 709. The earliest specimen of
      ancient glass now in existence is in the choir-aisles of Canterbury
      Cathedral, where it was probably fixed when the cathedral was rebuilt
      after the fire in 1174.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coloured glass is of two kinds: (1) <i>Stained glass</i>, made by mixing
      metallic oxides with the glass when in a state of fusion, the colours thus
      going through the whole mass; (2) <i>Painted glass</i>, in which colouring
      is laid upon the white or tinted glass, and fixed by the action of fire.
      As the style of architecture changed, so the art of the glass-painter
      changed with it. In the Early English period the colours were very rich,
      and the designs consisted of medallions containing subjects taken from
      Holy Scripture, or the lives of the saints, upon grounds of ruby and blue.
      Mosaic patterns form the groundwork of the medallions, and a border of
      scrolls and foliage incloses the whole design. The outlines of the figures
      are formed by the lead. In the Decorated period the medallions disappear,
      and in their place we find single figures of large size under canopies.
      Instead of the mosaic backgrounds diaper-work in whole colours is used.
      Lights and shades are introduced in the dresses and canopies, and foliage
      is painted on the panes. The artists of this period first introduced
      heraldic devices into the windows. A border of white glass intervenes
      between the window and the medallion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Perpendicular style was in vogue the art of the glass-painter
      degenerated, as did that of the architect. Stained glass was little used,
      and the artists painted with enamel colours their designs upon the glass.
      The figures were larger than before, and the canopies of great size and
      with much architectural detail, landscapes and buildings appearing in the
      background. During this period inscriptions began to be used. In the
      sixteenth century the progress of the art was in the same direction. Large
      figures, and groups of figures, fill the whole window, and the existence
      of mullions is disregarded in the execution of the design. Glass-painting
      flourished until the Civil War period, and then died out.
    </p>
    <p>
      English churches benefited much by the work of foreign artists. The great
      Florentine Francesco di Lievi da Gambassi visited this country. There is a
      letter dated 1434, written &ldquo;to the master glass-painter Gambassi,
      then in Scotland, and who made works in glass of various kinds, and was
      held to be the best glass-painter in the world.&rdquo; How much must we
      regret the destruction of the windows made by this excellent artist in
      Holyrood chapel and elsewhere by fanatical mobs! The Fairford windows are
      perhaps the finest and most interesting in England. The story runs that
      they were made in Germany for a church in Rome, and that the vessel
      conveying them was captured by an English ship; and as the noble church at
      Fairford was then being built, the glass was sent there and given to it.
      Shiplake Church, Oxfordshire, has some of the beautiful glass which once
      adorned the ruined church of St. Bertin at St. Omer, plundered during the
      French Revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some good work was accomplished in the seventeenth century by English
      artists, who practised enamel painting, notably by Jervais, who in 1717
      executed from designs by Sir Joshua Reynolds the beautiful west window of
      New College Chapel, Oxford.
    </p>
    <p>
      The floors of our churches were enriched with inlaid tiles. Various
      patterns and designs were impressed upon them when the clay was moist, a
      metallic glaze covered the surface, and then the tiles were placed in the
      furnace. Many designs are found on ancient tiles, such as heraldic
      devices, monograms, sacred symbols with texts, architectural designs,
      figures, and patterns. The age of the tiles may be determined by comparing
      the designs imprinted upon them with the architectural decorations
      belonging to particular periods. In the sixteenth century many Flemish
      tiles were brought to England, and superseded those of English
      manufacture.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Middle Ages no branch of art was neglected. Even the smith, who
      made the ironwork for the doors, locks, and screens, was an artist, and
      took pains to adapt his art to the style of architecture prevailing in his
      time. Norman doors are remarkable for their beautifully ornamented hinges.
      They have curling scrollwork, and a large branch in the form of the letter
      C issuing from the straight bar near the head. Early English doors have
      much elaborate scrollwork, with foliage and animals&rsquo; heads. During
      the Decorated period the hinges are simpler, on account of the carved
      panelling on the doors, and they continue to become plainer in the
      subsequent period. The knockers on the doors often assume very grotesque
      forms, as at Durham Cathedral. The mediaeval plumber was also an artist,
      and introduced shields of arms, fleur-de-lis, and other devices, for the
      enrichment of spires, and pipes for carrying off water from the roof.

    <p>
      No part of the ancient decoration of our churches has suffered more than
      the paintings and frescoes which formerly adorned their walls. In the
      whole of the country there are very few of the ancient edifices which
      retain any traces of the numerous quaint designs and figures painted on
      the inner surfaces of their walls during the Middle Ages. Our ancestors
      used to make free use of colour for the purpose of architectural
      decoration, and employed several means in order to produce the effect.
      They sometimes used fresco, by means of which they produced pictures upon
      the walls covered with plaster while the plaster was wet. Sometimes they
      employed wall-painting, <i>i.e.</i> they covered the walls when the
      plaster was dry with some pictorial representation. The distinction
      between fresco and wall-painting is frequently forgotten. Most of the
      early specimens of this art are monochromes, but subsequently the painters
      used polychrome, which signifies surface colouring in which various
      colours are employed. The vaulted ceilings, the timber roof, the screens
      and canopies, the monuments with their effigies, as well as the surface of
      the walls, were often coloured with diaper-work. Colour and gilding were
      marked features in all mediaeval buildings, and even richly carved fonts
      and sculptural monuments were embellished with this method of decoration.
      The appearance of our churches in those times must have been very
      different from what it is now. Then a blaze of colour met the eye on
      entering the sacred building, the events of sacred history were brought to
      mind by the representations upon the walls, and many an unlearned rustic
      acquired some knowledge of biblical history from the contemplation of the
      rude figures with which his village church was adorned.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Even the very walls of this dread place,<br /> And the tall windows,
      with their breathing lights,<br /> Speak to the adoring heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The practice of painting the walls of our churches dates as far back as
      Saxon times; but very few fragments of pre-Norman art remain. Of Norman
      work we have numerous examples, and sometimes it is found that the early
      specimens of the art have been painted over in later Gothic times, and
      ruder and larger figures have eclipsed the more careful work of previous
      ages. An example of this was discovered in the church of St. Lawrence,
      Reading, where no less than five distinct series of paintings were
      discovered, painted one over another.

      Several circumstances have combined to obliterate these specimens of the
      art of former days. It was not the intention of the Reformers themselves
      to destroy them. They distinguished carefully between &ldquo;an embossed
      and gilt image, and a process of a story painted with the gestures and
      action of many persons; and commonly the sum of the story written withal
      hath another use in it than one dumb idol or image standing by itself.&rdquo;
      It was left to the Puritans, impelled by fanaticism and ignorance, to make
      &ldquo;a slanderous desolation of the places of prayer,&rdquo; and it is
      to them we owe much of the destruction of the old mural paintings. At the
      end of the eighteenth century there was a prejudice against these works of
      art; for in 1773 we find the Bishop of London refusing to allow Reynolds,
      West, and Barry to clothe the naked walls of St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral
      with pictures painted by themselves. Coated over by layers of plaster, or
      whitewashed until all traces were obliterated, these relics of ancient art
      have remained for generations, and it is only when an old church is being
      restored, and the coats of plaster and whitewash removed, that their
      presence is revealed; and then too often the colours fade away on exposure
      to the air.

      One of the favourite subjects of mural decoration was a figure of St.
      Christopher with the Infant Saviour on his shoulder.[<a href="#linkb8">8</a>]
      He usually has a staff, and strange-looking fish swim about his feet as he
      crosses the river; on one side there is a hermitage, with the figure of a
      hermit holding a lantern to guide the saint, and on the other a windmill.
      This figure usually was painted on the wall opposite the principal
      entrance, as it was deemed lucky to see St. Christopher on first entering
      a church. Moreover the sight of the saint was a preservative against
      violent death during the day, and also a preventive against drowsiness
      during the service, as the following verses show:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Christophori sancti speciem quicunque tuetur &nbsp;&nbsp;Illo
      namque die nullo languore tenetur.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Churchwardens&rsquo; accounts record the painting of these figures&mdash;
    </p>

      A curious order was issued by Edward III. for arresting painters to work
      in St. Stephen&rsquo;s Chapel at Westminster, to which artists of every
      description were liable to surrender as often as the king required their
      services.

      In Saxon times Consecration crosses were painted on the interior walls,
      twelve in number, on the spots where the bishop marked the cross with holy
      oil; and sometimes twelve crosses were carved or painted on the exterior
      walls. During Norman times the art made progress, and there are many
      specimens of mural decoration of this period, which correspond with the
      mouldings generally used then; but not many scenes and figures were
      depicted. Representations of bishops, <i>Agnus Dei</i>, scenes from the
      life of our Lord, the apostles, the Last Judgment, St. George, scenes from
      the life of St. Nicholas, St. John writing the Apocalypse, were favourite
      subjects. At Copford the painter evidently tried to make the chancel
      figuratively to represent the glories of heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the reign of Henry III. great progress was made, and travelling
      monks roamed the country leaving behind them in many a village church
      traces of their skill in artistic decoration. The murder of St. Thomas of
      Canterbury now became a favourite subject, also the lives of St. Catherine
      of Alexandria, St. Nicholas, St. Margaret, St. Edmund, the Seven Acts of
      Mercy, and the wheel of fortune. In the fourteenth century the Doom was
      the usual decoration of the space over the chancel arch, and scenes from
      the New Testament, legends of saints, &ldquo;moralities,&rdquo; etc., were
      depicted on the walls. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the
      artists paid little respect to the work of their predecessors, and
      frequently painted new designs over the earlier mural decorations. They
      also adorned very beautifully the roofs and screens. The arrival of the
      Flemings in the eastern counties is shown by the portraying of subjects
      and saints not usually worshipped in England. The figures of St. George
      become more numerous and also of St. Christopher, who were regarded with
      much superstitious reverence by all classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vanity of human greatness is taught by the morality, &ldquo;Les Trois
      Rois Morts et les Trois Rois Vifs,&rdquo; representing three kings going
      gaily hunting meeting three skeletons, the remains of kings once as
      powerful as they. &ldquo;The Dance of Death,&rdquo; so popular abroad,
      also appears in some English churches. The wholesale destruction of so
      many specimens of mediaeval art cannot be too strongly condemned and
      deplored. If any of my readers should be fortunate enough to discover any
      traces of colouring hidden away beneath the coats of whitewash on the
      walls of their church, I would venture to advise them to very carefully
      remove the covering, and then to consult Mr. Keyser&rsquo;s book on <i>Mural
      Decorations</i>, where they will find an account of the best methods for
      preserving these valuable specimens of early art.

      In the churchyard stands the old weather-beaten yew tree, looking like a
      sentinel keeping watch over the graves of our forefathers. Some of these
      trees are remarkable for their age; the yews at Fountains Abbey, in
      Yorkshire, were probably in a flourishing condition so long ago as the
      year 1132, and some are older still. Why they were planted in churchyards
      it is difficult to ascertain. It has been conjectured that they were
      planted in so secure a spot in order that the men might provide themselves
      with bows, as all the bows used by the English, with which they did such
      execution against their enemies, were made of yew. Others contend that its
      green boughs were used instead of palms on Palm Sunday, or for funerals.
      But I think that they were regarded with veneration by our forefathers
      when they were still heathen, and that some religious symbolism&mdash;such
      as of immortality&mdash;attached to them; and that when the Christian
      teachers came they made use of this religious sentiment of the people,
      planted the Christian cross by the side of the yew, and under its shade
      preached lessons of true immortality, of which the heathen ideals were
      only corrupt legends and vain dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the entrance of the churchyard there is often a lich-gate, <i>i.e.</i>
      a corpse-gate, where the body may rest while the funeral procession is
      formed. <i>Lych</i> is the Saxon word for a dead body, from which
      Lich-field, &ldquo;the field of dead bodies,&rdquo; is derived. Bray, in
      Berkshire, famous for its time-serving vicar, is also famous for its
      lich-gate, which has two rooms over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&rsquo;s acre&rdquo; is full of holy associations, where sleep
      &ldquo;the rude forefathers of the hamlet.&rdquo; There stands the village
      cross where the preachers stood in Saxon times and converted the people to
      Christianity, and there the old sundial on a graceful stone pedestal.
      Sometimes amid the memorials of the dead stood the parish stocks. Here in
      olden days fairs were held, and often markets every Sunday and holiday,
      and minstrels and jugglers thronged; and stringent laws were passed to
      prevent &ldquo;improper and prohibited sports within the churchyard, as,
      for example, wrestling, football, handball under penalty of twopence
      forfeit.&rdquo; Here church ales were kept with much festivity, dancing,
      and merry-making; and here sometimes doles were distributed on the
      tombstones of parochial benefactors, and even bread and cheese scrambled
      for, according to the curious bequests of eccentric donors.

      And then there are the quaint epitaphs on the gravestones, of which many
      have made collections. Here is one to the memory of the driver of a coach

    <p>
      Bells play an important part in village life, and there are few more
      interesting branches of the study of village antiquities than bell-lore.
      Ringing customs throw much light upon the manners and doings of our
      ancestors. Bells rang to commemorate the great events in history, news of
      which was conveyed to the quiet village; they sounded forth the joys and
      sorrows of the parishioners in their generations, pealed merrily at their
      weddings, and mourned for them at their funerals. As the bell &ldquo;Roland&rdquo;
      of Ghent seemed endowed with a human voice, and was silenced for ever by
      Charles V. lest it should again rouse the citizens to arms, so these bells
      in our village steeples seem to speak with living tongues and tell the
      story of our village life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bells have great antiquity. Odoceus, Bishop of Llandaff, in 550 A.D., is
      said to have taken the bells away from his cathedral during a time of
      excommunication. Bede mentions them in the seventh century. In 680
      Benedict, Abbot of Wearmouth, imported some from Italy, and in the tenth
      century St. Dunstan hung many. Ireland probably had bells in the time of
      St. Patrick, who died in 493, and a bell that bears his name is preserved
      at Belfast. The earliest Saxon bells were not cast, but were made of
      plates of iron riveted together, and were probably used as hand-bells.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bells were usually christened. Those of Crowland Abbey were named Pega,
      Bega, Tatwin, Turketyl, Betelin, Bartholomew, and Guthlac. A fire in 1091
      destroyed this peal. Those of the priory of Little Dunmow, Essex,
      according to an old chartulary, were new cast and baptised in 1501.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prima in honore Sancti Michaelis Archangeli.&rdquo;<br /> &ldquo;Secunda
      in honore Sancti Johannis Evangelisti.&rdquo;<br /> &ldquo;Tertia in honore
      S. Johannis Baptisti.&rdquo;<br /> &ldquo;Quarta in honore Assumptionis
      beatae Mariae.&rdquo;<br /> &ldquo;Quinta in honore Sanctae Trinitatis et
      omnium sanctorum.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tenor bell at Welford, Berks, has the inscription, &ldquo;Missi de
      celis habeo nomen Gabrielis 1596.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bells dating from before the year 1600 are called &ldquo;ancients,&rdquo;
      and it is a very pleasant discovery to find one of these in our church
      tower; and still more so if it be a pre-Reformation bell. Unfortunately a
      large number of &ldquo;ancients&rdquo; have been recast, owing chiefly to
      the craze for change-ringing which flourished in England between 1750 and
      1830. The oldest bell in this country is said to be St. Chad&rsquo;s,
      Claughton, which bears the date 1296. Pre-Reformation bells are very
      seldom dated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mediaeval bells have many curious inscriptions on them, which record the
      name of the donor, the bell-founder, together with heraldic and other
      devices. The inscriptions are often written in the first person, the bell
      being supposed to utter the sentiment, as it sends forth its sound. A
      study of the inscriptions on bells is full of interest. The earliest are
      simple dedications of the bell to our Lord, or to some saint. The
      principal inscriptions of this class are: &ldquo;Jesus,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jesus
      Nazarenus Rex Judeorum,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sit nomen IHC benedictum,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Sum Rosa Pulsata Mundi Maria Vocata,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sum Virgo Sancta
      Maria.&rdquo; The invocation, &ldquo;Ora pro nobis,&rdquo; very frequently
      is inscribed on bells, followed by the name of some saint, and almost
      every saint in the Calendar is duly honoured in some bell inscription.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bells were always rung on joyful occasions; hence inscriptions expressing
      thankfulness and praise were appropriate. Consequently we find such words
      as &ldquo;Laus et Gloria Deo,&rdquo; &ldquo;Laus Deo Gratia
      Benefactoribus,&rdquo; &ldquo;Alleluja,&rdquo; &ldquo;Praise God,&rdquo;
      and other similar inscriptions of praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some old bells have Latin hexameter verses inscribed on them, composed by
      monks, which are called Leonine verses, from one Leoninus, a monk of
      Marseilles, who lived in the early part of the twelfth century. A few
      examples of these will suffice:&mdash;

          </p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      This refers to the belief that the ringing of bells drives away all demons
      and tempests, storms and thunders, and all other hurtful things. One bell
      proudly asserts:&mdash;

      Bell-ringing customs are very numerous.[<a href="#linkb9">9</a>] The
      passing bell has many variants. In some places three times three strokes
      are sounded for a man, three times two for a woman, and three times one
      for a child. Out of the first-named of these practices probably arose the
      phrase, &ldquo;Nine tailors make a man,&rdquo; which is usually explained
      as more properly signifying &ldquo;nine tellers make a man.&rdquo; Then we
      have a pancake bell, which formerly summoned people to confession, and not
      to eat pancakes; a gleaning bell, an eight hours&rsquo; bell rung at 4
      a.m., noon, and 8 p.m. The curfew bell survives in many places, which, as
      everyone knows, was in use long before William the Conqueror issued his
      edict. Peals are rung on &ldquo;Oak Apple Day,&rdquo; and on Guy Fawkes&rsquo;
      Day, &ldquo;loud enough to call up poor Guy.&rdquo; Church bells played a
      useful part in guiding the people homewards on dark winter evenings in the
      days when lands were uninclosed and forests and wild moors abounded, and
      charitable folk, like Richard Palmer, of Wokingham, left bequests to pay
      the sexton for his labour in ringing at suitable times when the sound of
      the bells might be of service to belated travellers. Names of benefactors
      often find a permanent memorial on the bells which they gave; as at
      Binstead, Hants, where a bell has the inscription&mdash;

      The story of our great bells, of &ldquo;Great Toms,&rdquo; &ldquo;Big
      Bens,&rdquo; &ldquo;Great Peters,&rdquo; need not be told here. They wake
      the echoes of our great cities, and are not heard among the hills and
      dales of rural England. Outside the church at the apex of the gable over
      the chancel arch there is sometimes a small bell-cote, wherein the sanctus
      or saunce bell once hung. This was rung during the service of High Mass
      when the <i>Ter Sanctus</i> was sung, in order that those who were engaged
      at their work might know when the canon of the Mass was about to begin, in
      order that they might kneel at the sound and pray to God. At Bosham
      Harbour the fishermen used to so join in the service of the sanctuary, and
      it is said that when George Herbert&rsquo;s sanctus bell sounded for
      prayers, the ploughmen stopped from their work for a few moments and
      prayed. The sanctus bell differed from the sacring bell, which was a
      hand-bell rung inside the church at the elevation of the Host.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old churchwardens&rsquo; accounts record the very frequent ringing of
      bells. In addition to the Great Festivals, Corpus Christi Day, Church
      feasts and ales, the occasions of royal visits, of episcopal visitations,
      victories, and many other great events, were always celebrated by the
      ringing of the church bells. In fact by the fondness of English folk for
      sounding their bells this country earned the title in the Middle Ages of
      &ldquo;the ringing island.&rdquo; Peal-ringing was indeed peculiar to
      England. It was not until the seventeenth century that change-ringing
      became general, and our old bells suffered much at the hands of the
      followers of the new fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In recent years the study of our church bells has made great progress, and
      many volumes have been written upon the bells of various counties. Too
      long have our bells been left to the bats and birds, and the belfry is
      often the only portion of a church which is left uncared for. We are
      learning better now, and the bells which have sounded forth the joys and
      sorrows of our villagers for so many generations are receiving the
      attention they deserve.

      THE MEDIAEVAL VILLAGE

    </p>
    <p>
      Let us try to imagine the ordinary life and appearance of a mediaeval
      English village in the &ldquo;piping times of peace.&rdquo; Of course, no
      two villages are quite alike; each has many distinguishing features; but a
      strong family likeness is observable. In the Middle Ages a village was
      much more independent than it is now. Then there were no Acts of
      Parliament to control its affairs, and it regulated its own conduct much
      to its own satisfaction, without any outside interference. Of course,
      sometimes things were managed badly; but the village knew it had only
      itself to blame, and therefore could not grumble at the Government, or the
      fickleness of members of Parliament, or the unreasonable conduct of Local
      Government Boards. Was not the lord of the manor quite capable of trying
      all criminals? and did not the rector and the vestry settle everything to
      the satisfaction of everyone, without any &ldquo;foreigners&rdquo; asking
      questions, or interfering?
    </p>
    <p>
      The position of the villeins and <i>cottiers</i> has changed considerably
      since the days of William the Norman. The former were now free tenants,
      who paid rent for their land to the lord of the manor, and were not bound
      to work for him, while the latter worked for wages like our modern
      agricultural labourer. There was thus in the twelfth century a gradual
      approximation to modern conditions on many estates; the home farm was
      worked by hired labourers who received wages; while the villeins had
      bought themselves off from the obligation of doing customary work by
      paying a quit-rent.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should like to know something of the way in which our ancestors farmed
      their land, and fortunately several bailiffs have left us their account
      books very carefully kept, and one Walter de Henley in 1250 wrote a book
      on the <i>Art of Husbandry</i>, which gives us much information. The rent
      of land was about sixpence per acre. They ploughed three times a year, in
      autumn, April, and at midsummer, and used oxen for their plough-teams.
      Women helped their husbands in ploughing and harvest work. An old writer
      describes the farmer&rsquo;s wife &ldquo;walking by him with a long goad,
      in a cutted cote cutted full high.&rdquo; Pigs and poultry were numerous
      on a mediaeval farm, but sheep were the source of the farmer&rsquo;s
      wealth. Large flocks of divers breeds roamed the hills and vales of rural
      England, and their rich fleeces were sent to Antwerp, Bruges, and Ghent
      for the manufacture of cloth by the Flemish weavers. After the Black
      Death, a great plague which ravaged the country in 1348, the labourers
      were fewer in number, and their wages higher; hence the farmers paid
      increased attention to their sheep, which yielded rich profits, and
      required few labourers to look after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to the advent of this grim visitor, the Great Plague, the prosperity
      of our villages had greatly increased. The people were better fed and
      better clothed than any of their neighbours on the Continent. Moreover
      they were free men, and enjoyed their freedom. There was much happiness in
      our English villages in those days, and &ldquo;Merry England&rdquo; was
      not a misnomer. There were, however, two causes of suffering which for a
      time produced untold wretchedness&mdash;two unwelcome visitors who came
      very frequently and were much dreaded&mdash;famine and pestilence. There
      is necessarily a sameness in the records of these pestilences.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief famine years were 1315 and 1316, but there is hardly any period
      of five years from the death of Edward I. to the coming of Henry of
      Richmond without these ghastly records of the sufferings of the people.
      Disease not only arrested the growth of the population, but reduced it
      considerably. It was mostly of a typhoid nature. The undrained soil, the
      shallow stagnant waters which lay upon the surface of the ground, the
      narrow and unhealthy homes, the filthy and neglected streets of the towns,
      the excessive use of salted provisions and absence of vegetables,
      predisposed the people to typhoid diseases, and left them little chance of
      recovery when stricken down with pestilence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Great Plague arrived in England in 1348 from the shores of Italy,
      whither it had been wafted from the East. It was probably carried to the
      port of Bristol by travelling merchants, whence it spread with alarming
      rapidity over the whole land. Whole villages were depopulated, and about
      one-third of the people of England perished. It is difficult for us to
      imagine the sorrow and universal suffering which the plague caused. Its
      effects were, however, beneficial to the villagers who survived. Naturally
      labourers became very scarce and were much sought after. Wages rose
      enormously. The tenants and rustics discovered that they were people of
      importance. Manor lords found it too expensive to farm their lands, and
      were eager to hand them over to their tenants, many of whom became much
      richer and more independent than formerly. The spirit of independence
      pervaded all classes. There came to our village many wandering friars,
      followers of Wiklif, who preached discontent to the labouring rustics,
      told them that the gentry had no right to lord it over them, that they
      were as good as their masters, who ought not to live in fine houses in
      luxury supported by their toil and the sweat of their brows. And when
      oppressive taxes were levied, the rustics revolted, and gained much for
      which they strove. The golden age of the English labourer set in, when
      food was cheap, wages high, and labour abundant. A fat pig could be bought
      for fourpence, and three pounds of beef for a penny; and in spite of
      occasional visits of the plague, the villager&rsquo;s lot was by no means
      unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a picture of village life in those days. The village church stood
      in the centre of the hamlet, with a carefully made fence around it, in
      order that no swine or foul beast might desecrate the graves. Surrounded
      by the churchyard, with its yew tree and lich-gate, the church was very
      similar to the old building wherein the villagers still worship. All the
      houses had thatched roofs, and chief among the other dwellings stood the
      lord&rsquo;s hall. Near the church was a curious building called the
      church house, which has almost entirely passed away, except in the records
      of old churchwardens&rsquo; accounts. It was a large building, in which
      could be stored wool, lime, timber, sand, etc., and was often let to
      pedlars, or wandering merchants, to deposit their goods during the fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this building there was a long low room with a large fireplace and
      hearth, around which a dozen or more could sit in comfort, except when the
      wind blew the smoke down the wide, open chimney; but our ancestors were
      accustomed to smoky chimneys, and did not mind them. In the centre of the
      room was a large oak table. This was the scene of some very festive
      gatherings. Aubrey thus describes the church house:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In every parish was a church house, to which belonged spits,
      crocks, and other utensils for dressing provisions. Here the housekeepers
      met. The young people were there too, and had dancing, bowling, shooting
      at butts, etc., the ancients [<i>i.e.</i> old folks] sitting gravely by,
      and looking on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The churchwardens bought, and received presents of, a large quantity of
      malt, which they brewed into beer and sold to the company. Hence these
      feasts were called &ldquo;church ales,&rdquo; and were held on the feast
      of the dedication of the church, the proceeds being devoted to the
      maintenance of the poor. Sometimes they were held at Whitsuntide also,
      sometimes four times a year, and sometimes as often as money was wanted or
      a feast desired. An arbour of boughs was erected in the churchyard on
      these occasions called Robin Hood&rsquo;s Bower, where the maidens
      collected money for the &ldquo;ales,&rdquo; and &ldquo;all went merry as a
      marriage bell&rdquo;&mdash;rather too merry sometimes, for the ale was
      strong and the villagers liked it, and the ballad-singer was so merry, and
      the company so hearty&mdash;and was it not all for a good cause, the
      support of the poor? The character of these festivals deteriorated so
      much, until at last &ldquo;church ales&rdquo; were prohibited altogether,
      on account of the excess to which they gave rise.

      <br /> AN ANCIENT VILLAGE <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a large amount of gaiety in the old villages in those days. Men
      were not in so great a hurry to grow rich as they are now. The Church
      authorised many holidays in the course of the year; and what with May Day
      festivities, Plough Mondays, Hocktide and Shrovetide sports, harvest
      suppers, fairs, and &ldquo;ales,&rdquo; the villagers had plenty of
      amusement, and their lives certainly could not be described as dull.
      Sometimes the village would be enlivened by the presence of a company of
      pilgrims on their way to the shrine of St. Thomas at Canterbury, or to
      Holywell, blessed by St. Winifred, in order to be cured of some disease.
      Although these pilgrims were deemed to be engaged on a religious duty,
      they certainly were not generally very serious or sad. Chaucer describes a
      very joyous pilgrimage in his <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, how the company met
      at the Tabard Inn, in Southwark, including the knight and the abbot, the
      prioress and the shipman, the squire and the merchant, the ploughman and
      sompnour (or summoner, &ldquo;of whose visage children were sore afeard&rdquo;),
      and rode forth gaily in the spring sunshine&mdash;

      Pilgrim crosses are numerous all over England, where the pilgrims halted
      for their devotions by the way, and sometimes we find churches planted on
      the roadside far from human habitations, with no parishioners near them;
      and some people wonder why they were so built. These were pilgrim
      churches, built for the convenience of the travellers as they wended their
      way to Canterbury. The villages through which they passed must have been
      much enlivened by the presence of these not very austere companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ordinary lives of the farmers were diversified by the visits to the
      weekly markets held in the neighbouring town, where they took their fat
      capons, eggs, butter, and cheese. Here is a curious relic of olden times,
      an ancient market proclamation, which breathes the spirit of former days,
      and which was read a few years ago at Broughton-in-Furness, by the steward
      of the lord of the manor, from the steps of the old market cross. These
      are the words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes, O yes, O yes![<a href="#linkb10">10</a>] The lord of the
      manor of Broughton and of this fair and market strictly chargeth and
      commandeth on Her Majesty&rsquo;s behalf, that all manners of persons
      repairing to this fair and market do keep Her Majesty&rsquo;s peace, upon
      pain of five pounds to be forfeited to Her Majesty, and their bodies to be
      imprisoned during the lord&rsquo;s pleasure. Also that no manner of person
      within this fair and market do bear any bill, battle-axe, or other
      prohibited weapons, but such as be appointed by the lord&rsquo;s officers
      to keep this fair or market, upon pain of forfeiture of all such weapons
      and further imprisonment. Also, that no manner of person do pick any
      quarrel, matter, or cause for any old grudge or malice to make any
      perturbation or trouble, upon pain of five pounds, to be forfeited to the
      lord, and their bodies to be imprisoned. Also, that none buy or sell in
      corners, back sides, or hidden places, but in open fair or market, upon
      pain of forfeiture of all such goods and merchandise so bought and sold,
      and their bodies to imprisonment. Also, that no manner of persons shall
      sell any goods with unlawful mete or measures, yards or weights, but such
      as be lawful and keep the true assize, upon pain of forfeiture of all such
      goods and further imprisonment. Lastly, if any manner of persons do here
      find themselves grieved, or have any injuries or wrong committed or done
      against them, let them repair to the lord or his officers, and there they
      shall be heard according to right, equity, and justice. God save the Queen
      and the lord of the manor!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And besides the weekly markets there were the great annual fairs, which
      lasted many days, and were frequented by all classes of the population.
      These fairs were absolutely necessary for the trade of the country in the
      days when few people travelled far from their own homesteads, and even the
      towns with their small number of inhabitants did not afford a sufficient
      market for the farmer&rsquo;s and trader&rsquo;s stock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greatest of all English fairs was held in the little village of
      Stourbridge, near Cambridge, now almost absorbed by the University town.
      Hither flocked merchants and traders from all parts of Europe. Flemish
      merchants brought their fine linen and cloths from the great commercial
      cities of Belgium. Genoese and Venetian traders came with their stores of
      Eastern goods. Spaniards and Frenchmen brought their wines, and the
      merchants of the Hanse towns of Germany sold furs and flax, ornaments and
      spices, while in return for all these treasures our English farmers
      brought the rich fleeces of their sheep, their corn, horses, and cattle.
      The booths were planted in a cornfield, and the circuit of the fair, which
      was like a well-governed city, was over three miles. The shops were built
      in streets or rows, some named after the various nations that congregated
      there, and others after the kind of goods offered for sale. There were
      Garlick Row, Bookseller&rsquo;s Row, Cook Row; there were a cheese fair, a
      hop fair, a wool fair, and every trade was represented, together with
      taverns, eating-houses, and in later years playhouses of various
      descriptions. In the eighteenth century one hundred thousand pounds&rsquo;
      worth of woollen manufactures was sold in a week in one row alone. A
      thousand pack-horses were used to convey the goods of the Lancashire
      merchants to this famous fair. Now railways have supplanted the
      pack-horses; fairs have had their day; the trade of the country can now be
      carried on without them; and their relics with their shows and
      shooting-galleries and steam roundabouts have become a nuisance.

      The peaceful life of the villagers was sometimes disturbed by the sounds
      and sights of conflict. The exciting tales of war are connected with the
      history of many an English village, and many &ldquo;little Wilhelmines&rdquo;
      and labouring &ldquo;grandsires&rdquo; have discovered &ldquo;something
      large and round,&rdquo; traces of these ancient conflicts and &ldquo;famous
      victories.&rdquo;

      Many a lance and sword, and gilt spur, beautifully enamelled, which once
      decked the heel of a noble knight, have been found in our fields, and

      Sometimes the spectres of armed knights and warriors are supposed to haunt
      these scenes of ancient slaughter, and popular superstition has handed
      down the memory of the battles which were fought so long ago. It tells us
      of the mythical records of the fights of King Arthur and his Knights of
      the Round Table by the banks of the River Douglas, which ran with blood
      for three days, so terrible was the slaughter. It tells us how stubbornly
      the Britons resisted the Roman armies, so that on one occasion not one
      Briton was left to tell the tale of their defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we visit the site of some battle with the history book in our hand,
      it is possible to imagine the lonely hillside peopled again with the dense
      ranks of English archers, or hear the clanging of the armour as the
      men-at-arms charged for &ldquo;St. George and merry England&rdquo;; and
      the air will be full again of the battle-cries, of the groans of the
      wounded and the shouts of the victors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visit the scene of the battle of Hastings. Here on the high ground,
      flanked by a wood, stood the brave English, under the leadership of
      Harold, with his banner, woven with gold and jewels, shining conspicuously
      in the morning sunlight. Here they stood in the form of a wedge; there
      they turned the Normans, and put them to flight. Then the Normans rallied,
      pretended to fly, decoyed the brave English from their position, and by
      stratagem succeeded in defeating them at last. Or go to the Madingley
      Windmill, near Cambridge, and see the fifteen miles of rich drained
      cornfields which intervene between &ldquo;Ely&rsquo;s stately fane&rdquo;
      and the spot on which you are standing. Here read Kingsley&rsquo;s
      well-known story of <i>Hereward; or, The Last of the English</i>, and
      instead of the rich cornfields you will see that black abyss of mud and
      bottomless slime into which sank the flower of Norman chivalry as they
      tried to cross that treacherous bog to conquer the gallant Hereward and to
      plunder the monastery of Ely, the last stronghold of the English. On they
      came, thousands upon thousands, rushing along the floating bridge which
      they had formed, until at last it gave way beneath the weight, and the
      black slime swallowed up the miserable wretches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or let us take our stand on the Round Tower, near the summit of the Edge
      Hill, and see the site of the first battle between the troops of Charles
      I. and the soldiers of the Parliament. The whole of that green lane was
      lined with troops. In a cottage which stood at our feet the king
      breakfasted before the battle; from that mound he surveyed the forces of
      the enemy. Just as the bells in yonder church had ceased to ring for
      service on Sunday afternoon the cannon began to roar, and the fight
      commenced. There Prince Rupert charged with headlong fury, carrying all
      before him. And so we can follow the fortunes of the fight until the brave
      Cavaliers retired to rest&mdash;

      The memory of many a fight is recorded in the names of the fields, places,
      and hills on which the battle raged. Lichfield (<i>i.e.</i> the field of
      the dead), Battlefield, Battle, Battleflats, Standard Hill, Slaughterford,
      and many others, all tell the tale of war and slaughter.

      In some parts of the country, especially in Oxfordshire, there are fine
      avenues of trees, which appear to lead to a large house; but when you have
      walked to the end of the trees there is nothing to be seen. These avenues
      tell the tale of war, of the destruction of the manor-house of some old
      Royalist who fought for his king when the &ldquo;Roundheads&rdquo; and
      Cromwell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ironsides&rdquo; were more than a match for the
      gallant Cavaliers. His house was destroyed, he and his sons killed, unless
      they were fortunate enough to escape to France and wait the merry time
      &ldquo;when the king should enjoy his own again.&rdquo; How many of our
      uplands and gentle vales have been stained with blood, and seen the
      terrible horrors of war, of which we in these favoured days know nothing
      from our own experience! We read about the sad battles and sieges which
      have taken place in other countries, but can hardly imagine the time when
      hostile soldiers were riding through our village lanes, and the noise of
      the cannon was booming in the distance, as on that famous Sunday morning
      in October, 1642, when Richard Baxter was disturbed in his preaching at
      Alcester by that strange sound, and knew that the terrible conflict had
      begun between the king and Parliament. Our English villages suffered very
      much. All farming was stopped, manor-houses destroyed, some of the best
      blood in England spilt, and many a home made desolate. Indeed, in some
      parts of the country the people had literally no bread to eat, and no
      clothing to cover their nakedness; and Cromwell ordered collections to be
      made in London for the relief of the distressed people in Lancashire. Then
      the old clergyman was driven from his flock, and some commissioner
      appointed who wrote in the register-books of the parish the names of the
      children who were born, but did not record their baptism as the clergyman
      did. And then some black-gowned Puritan, with his hair cut short, came and
      took possession of the living, and preached very long sermons about
      Cromwell &ldquo;girding his sword upon his thigh,&rdquo; and about blinded
      Papists, and about Mahershalal-hash-baz, who made haste to divide the
      spoil.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the glorious year 1660 everyone began to throw up his cap and
      welcome right royally the king from over the water; and the long-faced
      Puritan disappeared, and the writing in the register-books changed into
      that of a scholarly hand; and many of our churches were enriched by
      thankofferings of plate and other gifts, because the good people of
      England rejoiced exceedingly that their loved Church and her services were
      restored to them; and &ldquo;the king at last enjoyed his own again.&rdquo;
      The memory of the adventures of King Charles II., when he was endeavouring
      to escape from England after the last crushing defeat of the royal troops
      at Worcester, called by Cromwell &ldquo;the crowning mercy,&rdquo; still
      lingers in many of the country villages through which the unfortunate
      monarch passed. The king and a few faithful followers avoided the towns,
      passed the ford of the Salwarp at Hemford Mill, and proceeded by Chester
      Lane to Broadwaters and Kinfare Heath. Presently they reached Brewood
      Forest, where there stood two old hunting-lodges, built by the Giffards in
      troublous times as hiding-places for proscribed Papists. They were called
      White Ladies and Boscobel, and were inhabited by staunch Royalists named
      Penderel; so the king knew he would be safe there. He was disguised as a
      forester with leathern jerkin and trunk hose, his long hair cropped, and
      his hands blackened. All day he lay concealed in a coppice, and in the
      evening, under the name of Will Jackson, he supped with the Penderels, and
      then tried to cross the Severn, but all the fords and bridges were
      guarded. The next day he and Colonel Carlos remained concealed in a large
      oak near Boscobel, and the memory of Royal Oak day is still preserved. He
      had other narrow escapes, and was saved by Mistress Jane Lane, the
      beautiful daughter of Colonel Lane. A pass had been obtained for her and
      her groom to go to Abbot&rsquo;s Leigh, near Bristol. The plan was
      arranged that the king should act as groom; so Charles mounted his horse,
      and Mistress Lane sat behind him on a pillion, and together they rode
      through Warwickshire to Bristol. The king was nearly captured at Long
      Marston, for some troopers of Cromwell suspected the party, and came to
      examine the house where they rested. The cook, however, set Charles to
      wind up the jack, and because he was awkward struck him with the
      basting-ladle just as the soldiers entered the kitchen. Their suspicions
      were thus removed; and in this old house the remains of the jack are still
      preserved. The poor king was disappointed of his ship; the skipper
      unfortunately told his wife that he was going to take the king to France,
      and she was angry, and locked him up in his room, so that he could not
      fulfil his engagement. At last Lord Wilmot procured a ship for the
      fugitive king, who set sail joyfully from Shoreham, near Brighton, and
      reached Paris in safety. There must have been great excitement in the
      villages of England when the troopers were scouring the country in all
      directions, and the unfortunate king was known to be wandering about
      disguised as a servant.

      If there are any hills or high ground in your neighbourhood commanding an
      extensive view of the country, it is probable that in olden days a beacon
      was placed there, so that the country might be aroused in case of an
      invasion, and frequently we find that the tower of a church was used as a
      beacon, and occasionally the iron brazier remains, as at Little Budworth,
      Cheshire. When the Spaniards determined to invade England in the reign of
      &ldquo;Good Queen Bess,&rdquo; and sent the Invincible Armada, consisting
      of an enormous number of ships and men and guns, bonfires were placed on
      every hill; and when a gallant merchant vessel brought the news that the
      Spaniards were coming, the bonfires were lighted, and everyone prepared to
      resist their attack. Macaulay has told us in very stirring verse of how
      the news spread, as each fire was lighted,

      Again, within the memory of the old inhabitants of your village, the hill
      beacons were brought into use when Napoleon I. threatened to invade
      England; and on January 31, 1803, by some mistake, the fire on Hume
      Castle, in Berwickshire, was lighted; other beacons responded, and ere
      morning dawned thousands were marching ankle-deep through the dense mud of
      the winter roads to their appointed stations. The mistake was not without
      its uses, as Napoleon saw that England was ready, and did not venture to
      attack our shores. A similar accident took place in the reign of Henry
      VIII. There was a conspiracy against the king by the Roman Catholics, who
      did not like their monasteries being destroyed, called &ldquo;The
      Pilgrimage of Grace.&rdquo; Beacons were erected on the heights of Pendel,
      in Lancashire, and on the various hills of Yorkshire and Derbyshire; but
      the beacon on Pendel was fired before the conspirators were quite ready
      for action, and their plot came to nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again in the history of our country were these beacon fires lighted;
      but it was not to announce the approach of an enemy, but to reflect the
      gladness of the nation which for so many years had enjoyed the reign of so
      good a ruler as Queen Victoria, who has now passed away from us, and whom
      the whole nation mourns. And as we witnessed the sudden blaze of the
      beacons we thought, perhaps, of other occasions when they were used, and
      were thankful that rejoicings and thanksgivings were the cause, and not
      invasions or conspiracies.

      VILLAGE SPORTS AND PASTIMES

    <p>
      It is the custom of some writers to represent the lot of an English
      villager in past ages as having been particularly hard and disagreeable;
      to enlarge upon the scanty wages which he received; and to compare his
      position unfavourably with that of the agricultural labourer of the
      present day. I have already pointed out that the small wages which he
      received are no test of his poverty, because he received so much more in
      lieu of wages; and certainly he had far more opportunities of enjoyment
      and recreation than the present generation has. Now we have scarcely any
      village games or sports, except when some energetic rector or curate
      starts a cricket club. Old social customs, which added such diversity to
      the lives of the rustics two centuries ago, have died out. The village
      green, the source of so much innocent happiness, is no more; and a recent
      writer has observed that the ordinary existence of agricultural labourers
      is so dull that in East Anglia they have almost forgotten how to laugh!
    </p>
    <p>
      We will now try to realise how our village forefathers used to enjoy
      themselves, how they used to spend their holidays, and to picture to
      ourselves the scenes of happy social intercourse which once took place in
      our own hamlet. Every season of the year had its holiday customs and
      quaint manner of observance, some of them confined to particular counties,
      but many of them universally observed.

      On the eve of Twelfth Night, January 5th, we see the good farmer and his
      labourers in Devonshire joining hands round his apple trees, and singing&mdash;

      A hearty supper followed, and with laughter, songs, and good wishes to the

      Herefordshire, Yorkshire, and other parts of England similar customs
      prevailed.

      Then followed Twelfth Night, which was celebrated by great rejoicings and
      merry-makings, a game called the choosing of kings and queens being
      played, and Twelfth Night cakes consumed in plenty. The next Monday was
      called Plough Monday, when the labourers used to draw a plough round the
      parish and receive presents of money, favouring the spectators with
      sword-dancing and mumming, preparatory to beginning to plough after the
      Christmas holidays. The men were decked out with gay ribbons, and were
      accompanied by morris-dancers. The Christmas holidays lasted these twelve
      days, and during them it was customary for the gentlemen to feast the
      farmers, and for the farmers to feast their labourers. Then came the
      Shrovetide festivities, on Shrove Tuesday, when pancakes, football, and
      cock-fighting, and a still more barbarous custom of throwing sticks at
      hens, were generally in vogue. On Mid-Lent Sunday, commonly called &ldquo;Mothering
      Sunday,&rdquo; it was the pleasing custom for servants and apprentices to
      carry cakes or furmity as presents to their mother, and to receive from
      her a cake with her blessing. This was called &ldquo;going a-mothering.&rdquo;
      The old poet Herrick alludes to the custom in Gloucestershire in these
      words:&mdash;

    <p>
      Then came the diversions of Hocktide, on the second Monday and Tuesday
      after Easter, when the men and women intercepted the public on alternate
      days with ropes, and boldly exacted money for pious purposes. There was a
      Hocktide play, which was acted before Queen Elizabeth, and caused her much
      amusement. She gave the players two bucks and five marks of money, which
      delighted them exceedingly.

      Very shortly afterwards the great rural festival of our forefathers took
      place, the glad May Day, when, in the early dawn, the lads and lassies
      left their towns and villages, and going into the woods to the sound of
      music, gathered the may or blossomed branches of the tree, and bound them
      with wreaths of flowers. At sunrise they returned, and decorated the
      lattices and doors with the sweet-smelling spoil of their joyous journey,
      and spent the rest of the day in sports and pastimes, and dancing round
      the Maypole. The setting-up of the May-pole was a very joyous ceremony. A
      long string of oxen, gaily decked with flowers, drew to the village green
      the time-honoured pole, decked with streamers, flowers, and flags, where
      it was raised amidst laughter and shouts; and the Queen of the May was
      enthroned in an arbour and all danced round; and the morris-dancers, Robin
      Hood, Friar Tuck, and Maid Marian performed wonderful antics as they led
      the revels. Targets were set up at the other end of the green, and archery
      formed an important part of the day&rsquo;s pleasures. The preachers at
      the time of the Reformation thought the people made an idol of the
      Maypole, and condemned the innocent amusements, which were revived again
      when Charles II. came to the throne. After May Day our villagers had not
      long to wait until the Whitsuntide holiday came round&mdash;

      I have already given a description of these Whitsuntide rejoicings in a
      preceding chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there were the miracle plays, or &ldquo;mysteries,&rdquo; as they
      were called, in June, on Corpus Christi Day, which were performed before
      the Reformation, principally in the neighbourhood of large monasteries;
      Coventry, Chester, London, York being specially renowned for these
      performances. The subjects were taken from Holy Scripture, or from the
      lives of saints, and were intended to teach the people religious
      knowledge, but the scenes were disfigured by many absurdities and
      grotesque perversions. Their history is a curious one, too long to enter
      upon in this chapter; but often in the open fields, at the bottom of
      natural amphitheatres, were these plays performed, very similar in
      construction to the famous passion play performed by the peasants, at Ober
      Ammergau, in Bavaria, the last surviving specimen of the ancient religious
      drama.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there were the bonfires to be lighted on St. John&rsquo;s Day upon
      the hillsides, and the dance of the young people around them, the more
      venturesome youths leaping through the flames, all carrying home the
      firebrands and forming a glad procession. Afterwards followed the busy
      harvest-time, when everyone was too hard at work, and too tired at the end
      of the day&rsquo;s labours, to think of holiday-making; but at length came
      the harvest home, when the last sheaf was gathered in, and the harvest
      supper was a very joyous occasion. With light hearts, smiling faces, and
      cheerful shouts, the harvest labourers and their wives and children,
      carrying green boughs, a sheaf of wheat, and rude flags, formed a glad
      procession to the farmer&rsquo;s house, where they found the fuelled
      chimney blazing wide, and &ldquo;the strong table groaning beneath the
      smoking sirloin.&rdquo; The feast over, they retired to some near hillock,
      and made the welkin ring with their shouts, &ldquo;Holla, holla, holla,
      largess!&rdquo;&mdash;largess being the presents of money and good things
      which the farmer had bestowed. Such was the harvest home in the good old
      days, a joy and delight to both old and young. Shorn of much of its
      merriment and quaint customs, it still lingers on; but modern habits and
      notions have deprived it of much of its old spirit and light-heartedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The floors of the old churches were formerly unpaved and unbearded, simply
      made of clay, and were covered over with rushes. Once a year there was a
      great ceremony, called &ldquo;rush-bearing.&rdquo; Rushes were cut in the
      neighbouring marsh, and made up into long bundles, decked with ribands and
      flowers. Then a procession was formed, everyone bearing a bundle of
      rushes, or placing them in the rush-cart beautifully adorned; and with
      music, drums, and ringing of bells, they marched to the church and strewed
      the floor with their honoured burdens. Long after the rushes ceased to be
      used in church the ceremony was continued, and I have myself witnessed a
      rush-bearing procession such as I have described. A village feast,
      followed by dancing round the May-pole, generally formed the conclusion to
      the day&rsquo;s festivities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beating the bounds&rdquo; of the parish was another annual
      ceremony, which often took place on Ascension Day and is still in use at
      Oxford. Boundaries of property were not so clearly defined in those days
      as they are now; and hedgerows, walls, and railings were scarce. The
      bounds of the parish were often marked by trees, called &ldquo;gospel
      trees,&rdquo; because the clergyman used to read the gospel for the day
      under their shade. The people carried a processional cross and willow
      wands, and boys were generally flogged at the boundaries, or ducked in the
      river, if that constituted a boundary, in order to impress upon their
      memories where the bounds were. The village feast afterwards made some
      amends to them for their harsh treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The village sports were a great source of enjoyment, and were frequently
      indulged in. The time-honoured archery developed the skill of our English
      bowmen, and won for them many a battle before the days of gunpowder and
      cannons. Then there was the very ancient game of the quintain, which
      consisted of an upright post with a cross-post turning upon a pin. At one
      end of the latter was a broad board, at the other a heavy sand-bag. The
      play, which required skill and dexterity, was to ride against the broad
      end with a lance, and pass by before the sandbag, swinging round, could
      strike the player to the ground. This was a common sport at wedding
      festivities. There were also the games of singlestick, cudgelling, and
      wrestling, which had many votaries, and the famous game of quarter-staff,
      so general in Berkshire, and so graphically described in <i>The Scouring
      of the White Horse</i>, by Mr. Hughes. An old parishioner of mine was the
      reputed champion of this game, which has now almost died out. Football is
      an ancient sport, and the manner formerly in vogue most nearly resembles
      the game authorised by the Rugby rules. The football was thrown down in
      the churchyard, and the object was to carry it perhaps two or three miles,
      every inch of ground being keenly contested. &ldquo;Touch-downs&rdquo;
      were then unknown, but it is evident from old records that &ldquo;scrimmages&rdquo;
      and &ldquo;hacking&rdquo; were much in vogue. Sack-racing, grinning
      through horse-collars, running after pigs with greased tails, were some of
      the lighter forms of amusement which pleased the villagers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in the winter evenings there were &ldquo;carols&rdquo; to be
      practised for Christmas, and each village boasted of its own musicians,
      who played violins, flutes, clarionets, and other instruments in church,
      before the days of harmoniums and organs. Their music might not be of a
      very first-rate order, but they delighted in it, took an interest in it;
      and how pleased they were to take part in the service, and to play over
      their favourite hymn tunes, with a great many twirls and variations, to
      their children during the winter evenings! Christmas brought its
      accustomed merry-makings. In the north every farmer gave two feasts, one
      called &ldquo;t&rsquo; ould foaks&rsquo; neet,&rdquo; and the other
      &ldquo;t&rsquo; young foaks&rsquo; neet.&rdquo; Here is Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s
      description of an ancient Christmas:&mdash;

    <p>
      Such was the manner of keeping Christmas in olden times; and if &ldquo;the
      mightiest ale&rdquo; was sometimes too mighty, and although the
      intemperance of our forefathers was a vice much to be deplored, at any
      rate their hearty manner of keeping this annual feast was effectual in
      promoting &ldquo;goodwill amongst men,&rdquo; and in cheering the hearts
      of the poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this chapter I have attempted to show the varied amusements and
      recreations in which our village ancestors took part. On the old village
      green, which in too many of our villages has been inclosed and become a
      thing of the past, many of these sports and pastimes once took place.
      There stood the village stocks, in which the refractory paid the penalty
      of their misdeeds; and sometimes, too, a pillory was added, which held
      fast the head, arms, and legs of the culprit, while the villagers, rude
      vindicators of the law, threw stones, rotten eggs, and other missiles at
      the unhappy victim. At the edge of the pond you might have seen a long
      plank which turned on a swivel, with a chair at the end overhanging the
      water. This was called a &ldquo;cucking-stool,&rdquo; and was used to duck
      scolds or brawlers. The culprit was placed in the chair, and the other end
      of the plank was raised several times, so that the ardour of the culprit
      was effectually cooled by frequent immersions. These were rough methods of
      administering justice, but often very effectual in checking vice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The social customs which formerly existed in each village, the sports and
      pastimes associated with the village green, the May Day festivals, and the
      Christmas carollings were of great value, inasmuch as they tended to
      infuse some poetical feeling into the minds of the people, softened the
      rudeness of rustic manners, and gave the villagers simple pleasures which
      lightened their labours. They prevented them from growing hard, grasping,
      and discontented with their lot. They promoted good feeling between the
      farmers and their labourers. The customs of the town were a poor exchange
      for the ancient country manners and amusements; and it was a sad day for
      our country when the villagers lost their simplicity and the power of
      appreciating the primitive pleasures of rural England.

      CHAPTER XXII

    <h3>
      THE VILLAGE INN
    </h3>
    <p>
      Monastic inns&mdash;Village inns&mdash;Highwaymen&mdash;Inn signs&mdash;Famous
      inns&mdash; Man-traps.
    </p>
    <p>
      In almost every village in England there is an inn. Before the Reformation
      there were very few of these hostelries, as travellers were always
      accommodated at the monasteries, each of which, as we have seen, had a
      hospitium, or guest-house, where their wants were attended to by special
      officers appointed for the purpose, and where they could remain for
      several days. But the destruction of the monasteries produced many changes
      in the condition of the country; it introduced the necessity of a poor
      law, for the poor were always relieved by the monasteries; it required the
      erection of schools and places for education, as all the education of the
      country had been carried on in these monastic buildings; and when the old
      guesthouses ceased to exist, travellers, merchants, and pedlars required
      some place in which to lodge when they moved about the country, and inns
      became plentiful as time went on. Hence in almost every village in England
      there is an inn, which is generally a landmark; and if you wish to direct
      a stranger to some place where he desires to go, you doubtless tell him to
      turn to the right by &ldquo;The Bull,&rdquo; or to keep straight on until
      he comes to &ldquo;The Magpie.&rdquo; Indeed, a friend of mine, who is a
      strong teetotaler, asserts that the only good use inns have is to help
      people to find their road. But old inns have a great history. In former
      days they used to be meeting-places of plotters and conspirators. All the
      distinguished people in the country used to pass through the villages and
      towns on the great roads through the country, and when the horses were
      being changed they used to partake of the good fare which the landlord
      provided. Those were busy times for the old inns, when there was stabling
      for fifty or sixty horses, and the coaches used to rattle through the
      village to the inn door long before the iron horses began to drag their
      freight of passengers along the iron roads, and the scream of the engines
      took the place of the cheerful notes of the posthorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes a gentleman would ride to an inn door on a beautiful,
      fleet-looking steed, and receive a hearty welcome from the landlord; but
      the pistols in his belt looked ominous, and presently some soldiers would
      steal noiselessly into the inn where the gentleman was refreshing himself,
      and there would be heard the sounds of vigorous fighting; and often, in
      some wonderful way, Claude Duval or the noted Dick would fight his way
      out, whistle to his steed, jump into the saddle, and ride away before his
      less nimble pursuers had recovered from their astonishment. Very many
      exciting scenes have taken place in our old inns, but in these days
      railways have changed all things; and in many streets where the coaches
      used to rattle along, and the place was alive with merry sounds, the moss
      now grows, and all is silence and desolation. We should certainly think it
      inconvenient to take three days to travel from London to Bath, and it
      would not be pleasant to have a visit from Dick Turpin on the way, and to
      have all one&rsquo;s valuables appropriated by that notorious highwayman;
      but in these days of worry and busy bustling it would be refreshing to
      catch a glimpse of those quiet times when people were not so much in a
      hurry, and to hear the sound of the posthorn once more instead of the
      whistle of the steam-engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quaint-looking pictures and curious names which attract our notice as
      we pass an inn door have some queer stories to tell. We notice a very
      curious collection of animals sometimes, and a strange assortment of
      things; and the reason why our ancestors put some of these curious things
      together is somewhat difficult for us to find out. In olden days, other
      houses of tradesmen besides inns had signs. Grocers, tailors,
      candlestick-makers, all had signs; but most of these have disappeared,
      except one belonging to a certain sweep of my acquaintance, whose house is
      adorned with the figure of a man coming out of a globe, with the motto,
      &ldquo;Help me through the world.&rdquo; Over their doors barbers still
      have their poles, which represented once the fact that the barber was
      prepared to bandage up wounded arms and legs, and to perform the office of
      blood-letting; the stripes on the pole were intended to represent the
      bandages, and the barber was the surgeon of the town. We do not seem to
      have so much blood to spare as our forefathers, as the barber always bled
      his customers once or twice a year, especially in the springtime, the
      operation being considered very beneficial.
    </p>
    <p>
      One reason for the curious mixture of animals and other things which we
      see on signboards is that an apprentice, when he had finished his time and
      begun to set up for himself, adopted some sign, and then joined with it
      the sign of his old master. This will account for such curiosities as
      &ldquo;The Lamb and Dolphin,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Goose and Gridiron,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;The Fox and Seven Stars,&rdquo; combinations of things for which it
      would otherwise be difficult to account. Another reason is that signs were
      taken from the armorial bearings, or crests, of some popular character, or
      of some great family in the neighbourhood. For example, I may mention
      &ldquo;The Bear with the Ragged Staff,&rdquo; which was the crest of
      Richard Nevil, Earl of Warwick, commonly called &ldquo;The Kingmaker,&rdquo;
      who was slain in the battle of Barnet, 1471 A.D. &ldquo;The Blue Boar&rdquo;
      was one of the badges of the House of York. &ldquo;The Bull&rdquo; is a
      very common sign, because it was a very common crest, and we have them in
      all colours&mdash;black, red, white; lions also rage in blue, white, and
      red attire. Sometimes we meet with &ldquo;The Cross Keys,&rdquo; the
      keeper of which was probably an old servant or tenant of an abbey or
      monastery, and chose his sign from that of the monastery with which he was
      connected. Frequently, in olden times, a cross was erected at the meeting
      of two or three roads, or where the pilgrims to Canterbury used to pass;
      afterwards an inn was built near it, and was, in many cases, called the
      Cross Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      One very common cause of curious signs is the way in which the original
      word has been corrupted by ignorant people frequently repeating words
      which they did not understand, and thus changing their whole meaning. You
      may have seen an inn described as &ldquo;The Swan with Two Necks&rdquo;&mdash;a
      very rare bird indeed. But it was never intended to disfigure the bird by
      giving it two necks; the original sign was &ldquo;The Swan with Two <i>Nicks</i>&rdquo;
      and nicks were the marks which were cut on a swan&rsquo;s bill to
      distinguish it from other swans, so that it might be known to whom the
      bird belonged. But <i>nicks</i> became <i>necks</i> in course of
      conversation, until at last a fabulous creature with two beautifully
      curved necks appeared on the signboard. This same cause will account for
      the two strange signs, &ldquo;Bull and Gate&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bull and
      Mouth.&rdquo; The original signs were &ldquo;Boulogne Gate&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Boulogne Mouth,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> the gate and harbour of the town
      of Boulogne, in France, which was captured by the English under King Henry
      VIII. in the year 1544. The English were very pleased to hear of the
      defeat of the French, and of the taking of that important town, and
      several inns were named in honour of the event; but the French &ldquo;Boulogne&rdquo;
      was too much for our good English mouths to speak, so it became &ldquo;Bull
      and.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Another name which puzzled our forefathers was &ldquo;<i>La Belle Sauvage</i>&rdquo;
      (&ldquo;the Beautiful Savage&rdquo;), which was named after a noted savage
      beauty who was the rage at Paris. Others assert that the name of the
      landlady was Isabella Savage, shortened into Bella Savage. However, in
      course of time the name was altered into &ldquo;Bell and Savage,&rdquo;
      and a picture representing this odd combination stood over the door. In
      the same way the original sign, &ldquo;Whip and Nag,&rdquo; between which
      there is often a very close connection, became &ldquo;Whip and Egg&rdquo;;
      and the reason why these two articles should be placed together is not so
      evident. So also there does not seem any reason for an inn to be called
      &ldquo;Bag o&rsquo; Nails&rdquo;; but when we are told that the original
      word was &ldquo;Bacchanals,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> followers of Bacchus, the
      old god of wine, we can understand how the corruption, &ldquo;Bag o&rsquo;
      Nails,&rdquo; arose. Before the days of licensing, when everyone could
      sell liquor who chose without obtaining any licence from the magistrates,
      it was the custom to put a bush over the doorway, in order to inform the
      passers-by that liquor could be purchased there. This is the origin of the
      saying, &ldquo;Good wine needs no bush.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;The Catherine Wheel&rdquo; tells us the sad story of St. Catherine,
      who was born at Alexandria, and for converting fifty heathen philosophers
      to Christianity was sentenced by the Emperor Maxentius to death on a
      wheel, devised by most ingenious cruelty, armed with knives, saws, and
      nails. It is recorded that she was rescued from this fate, but was
      afterwards beheaded (305 A.D.). It is curious that this instrument of
      torture and the story of St. Catherine&rsquo;s heroism should be recorded
      on a signboard. But it may have been brought before the public by a
      certain miracle play, founded on the life of St. Catherine, which used to
      be performed on festival days. However, the Catherine wheel appears
      frequently on the coats-of-arms of several families, and it may be that
      the sign was taken from these.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The George,&rdquo; also, is a very popular sign; and the &ldquo;St.
      George of merry England&rdquo; is the patron saint of this country, and
      the battle-cry of her knights and yeomen of ancient days. Who does not
      remember that stirring scene on St. George&rsquo;s Mount during the
      Crusades, described in Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s <i>Talisman</i>, when King
      Richard tore down the Austrian banner, which the Austrian monarch had
      dared to erect beside the Royal Standard of England? St George is
      generally represented as slaying a dragon. He was a soldier who served
      gallantly under the Emperor Diocletian, and commanded a legion of
      soldiers; he was a Christian, and by the dragon whom he slew is meant the
      devil, red with the blood of the Christians. So popular a personage as St.
      George, whose name inspired our ancestors with courage, and was often
      borne by them into the heart of the foe, would soon be recorded in
      paintings and become a general sign. &ldquo;The Goat&rdquo; is a common
      sign, and is taken from the crest of the Duke of Bedford; but &ldquo;The
      Goat and Compasses&rdquo; has puzzled many people as to its origin. It
      appears to be a corruption of a pious expression, &ldquo;God encompasseth
      us&rdquo;; and this shows how strangely words may be twisted and converted
      by ignorant and careless usage.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some very noted inns where great events have taken place,
      amongst which I may mention the Bull Inn at Coventry. Here Henry VII. was
      entertained the night before the battle of Bosworth Field, when he won for
      himself the English crown. Here Mary Queen of Scots was detained by order
      of Elizabeth. Here the conspirators of the Gunpowder Plot met to devise
      their scheme for blowing up the Houses of Parliament. And when the
      citizens refused to open their gates to Charles I. and his soldiers, no
      doubt there were great disputings amongst the frequenters of &ldquo;The
      Bull&rdquo; as to what would be the result of their disloyal refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the inns in remote country places did not enjoy a very enviable
      reputation, and were little better than man-traps, where the unfortunate
      traveller was robbed and murdered. At Blewbury, in Berkshire, there was an
      inn, the landlord of which was suspected of murdering his guests with
      great secrecy and mystery, and no one could tell what he did with the
      bodies of the victims he was supposed to have murdered. A few years ago an
      old tree in the neighbourhood of the inn was blown down, and on digging up
      the roots a skeleton was found among them. People wondered how it could
      have been placed there, but at last a very old inhabitant told the story
      of the mysterious disappearance of the bodies of the late landlord&rsquo;s
      guests, and the mystery was at length accounted for. Whenever he slew a
      man he planted a tree, placing the body of the murdered victim beneath it.
      The constables never thought of looking there; and probably under every
      tree which he planted (and there were several), when their roots are dug
      up, the bones of his numerous victims will be discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another story is connected with the old &ldquo;Hind&rsquo;s Head&rdquo; at
      Bracknell, which was another of these mantraps, where many travellers
      slept to rise no more. One winter&rsquo;s night a stout-hearted farmer
      stayed there, and joined several jovial companions round the kitchen fire.
      They ate and drank merrily, and at last the serving-maid showed the
      traveller to his chamber. She told him that he was surrounded by robbers
      and murderers, showed him a trap-door at the side of the bed, on which if
      he stepped he would tumble headlong into a deep well. She directed him to
      tie the bed into a bundle, put it on the trap-door, and escape by the
      window. He did so; down went the bundle, instead of the farmer, into the
      well, and he managed to effect his escape. Rousing the neighbourhood he
      captured the villains, who were all executed, and the bones of many of
      their victims were found in the well. Happily such inns were rare.
    </p>
    <p>
      To describe the conditions of the old inns for which England was famous,
      of the good fare which awaited the travellers by the coach, of the
      spacious corridors, of the comfortable beds hung with silk and smelling of
      lavender; to tell of all the great folk who entered their doors&mdash;kings,
      queens, poets, generals, highwaymen, statesmen, grooms, conspirators,
      coachmen&mdash;all this would require much space to relate. When railways
      came in, their ancient glory departed; the old stables are destroyed;
      grass grows in the courtyard; and the object of their existence has almost
      ceased to be.

      VILLAGE SUPERSTITIONS AND FOLKLORE

    </p>
    <p>
      There is yet another class of subjects connected with old village life, of
      absorbing interest and importance. I refer to the old superstitions and
      folklore which still linger on in the recollections of the &ldquo;oldest
      inhabitant,&rdquo; and which ought to be at once treasured up, lest they
      should be altogether lost. The generation of those who believed firmly in
      the power of the &ldquo;evil eye&rdquo; of the witch, and who feared to
      disturb the revels of the fairies on their rings and mounds, is only just
      passing away. An old gipsy has told me some strange stories of the
      superstitions of former days. He has told me of the witch at Farnham who
      made the cows wild and prevented them from giving milk; of another witch
      who lived at Henley-on-Thames, and who when thrown into the river &ldquo;floated
      like a cork.&rdquo; Here we have a survival of the old Saxon method of
      trying culprits by the water ordeal, often used in examining witches. This
      particular witch could turn herself into a hare, so my venerable gipsy
      friend, aged one hundred and six years, informed me, and the dogs hunted
      her. He told me of the Tadley witch, who &ldquo;wished&rdquo; several
      people, and greatly injured them. It seems to have been a common practice
      of the old witches to turn themselves into hares, in order to vex the
      squires, justices, and country parsons, who were fond of hunting, as the
      old dames could elude the speed of the swiftest dogs. An old writer states
      &ldquo;that never hunters nor their dogs may be bewitched, they cleave an
      oaken branch, and both they and their dogs pass over it.&rdquo; Mary Dore,
      a witch of Beaulieu, Hampshire, used to turn herself into a hare in order
      to escape detection when caught in the act of wood-stealing, to which she
      was somewhat addicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old women were rather harshly used in the days when people believed in the
      power of witches. If any farmer&rsquo;s cattle died, it was immediately
      concluded that the animals were bewitched; and some wretched old woman was
      singled out, and summarily tried and burnt. If anyone fell ill, some
      &ldquo;witch&rdquo; had evidently a waxen image of the sufferer, and stuck
      needles into it; and such was the power of the witch that, wherever the
      person was, he felt the stab of the cruel needle. Hence the witch had to
      be found and burnt. If the corn crops failed, was not witchcraft the
      cause? for had not old Mother Maggs been heard to threaten Farmer Giles,
      and had not her black cat been seen running over his fields? Even good
      Bishop Jewel did not disbelieve in the power of the evil eye. In preaching
      before Queen Elizabeth he said: &ldquo;It may please Your Grace to
      understand that witches and sorcerers are marvellously increased within
      Your Grace&rsquo;s realm. Your Grace&rsquo;s subjects pine away even unto
      the death, their colour fadeth, their flesh rotteth, their speech is
      benumbed, their senses are bereft. I pray God they never practise further
      than on the subject.&rdquo; To so great an extent did faith in the witches&rsquo;
      fatal power prevail. Our forefathers used to believe in the existence of
      other, and more pleasant little companions than the old toothless witches&mdash;the
      bright little fairies who, on account of the neglect which they have
      received from the present generation of Englishmen, have, so it is
      reported, left our shores in disgust, never to return. The previous
      inhabitants of our villages did not so treat them; and did not the fairies
      always bring them luck? They nailed the horseshoe to the stable door to
      keep out the witches, lest the old beldams should ride their steeds by
      night to the witches&rsquo; revels; but no one wished to exclude the
      fairies. Did not the dairymaids find the butter ready churned, and the
      cows milked by these kind assistants? Was there not an old lady in
      Yorkshire who knew all about the fairies, had often heard them making
      butter, and had seen the butter smeared all over the gate by a little
      green man with a queer cap who had been seen slipping under a culvert?
      Canon Atkinson told us of this lady who knew all these strange things, and
      of the Hart Hall &ldquo;Hob&rdquo; who worked so hard with his flail, and
      of many other curious folk who frequented the Yorkshire moors in olden
      days. The last witch had just died before he went to Danby, but he found
      the whole atmosphere of the folklore firmament so surcharged with the
      being and work of the witch, that he seemed able to trace her presence and
      her activity in almost every nook and corner of the neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wells all over England were haunted by fairies, and is it not
      confidently asserted that &ldquo;the good people&rdquo; (as the fairies
      are called) live in wilds and forests, and shun great cities because of
      the wickedness which exists therein? Have they never appeared to the
      lonely traveller, clothed in green, with long hair floating over their
      shoulders, and with faces more blooming than the blush of a summer
      morning? Then there were the fairy rings formed by the dancing of their
      merry feet.

      Then there were brownies; and knockers, who worked in mines, and showed
      rich veins of silver; and elves&mdash;all of whom were included in old
      village superstitions, and many were the tales told of the good deeds they
      did, and the luck they brought. Nor must we forget the story of the
      invisible smith who inhabited Wayland Smith&rsquo;s Cave, in Berkshire.
      Whenever a farmer tied up his horse in the cave, and left the money on a
      particular stone, on his return he found his horse shod by the kind
      efforts of the invisible smith. There is also the old Berkshire story of
      the old witch who lived in a cave by the roadside, and who, by the power
      of her &ldquo;evil eye,&rdquo; could stop the strongest team of horses, so
      that, however much the carters lashed and swore at them, the animals would
      not budge an inch until she permitted them to go. Here are a few of the
      common superstitions current in Berkshire. If a corpse be kept over a
      Sunday another death will occur before the week is out; should a big
      bumble-bee enter the window, a guest may be expected; and when the
      woodpecker, commonly called the yaffle, laughs, they say the rain is
      coming. When the thick mist lies in the valley, the people say it is the
      White Lady, a belief closely akin to the Dame Blanche, who is said in
      Normandy to haunt streams. If one row of freshly sown seeds or potatoes
      does not come up, it foretells a death in the family. If a girl mends her
      clothes on her back, she risks having a drunken husband. A screech-owl is
      unlucky, and so also is it if a bird fly against the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman came to the rectory a few years ago for a drop of sacramental
      wine, which she wanted for an infant who had &ldquo;the graspings.&rdquo;
      This complaint I discovered to be a craving for something, accompanied by
      restlessness; and it was supposed that a drop of sacramental wine would
      cure an infant so troubled. If the mother before the child was born craved
      for drink, this craving was communicated to the child, and could only be
      remedied by a drop of wine used in Holy Communion. This superstition,
      which I have met with elsewhere, probably is a relic of pre-Reformation
      days, and of sacramental Reservation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tramp was passing through a Hampshire village a short time ago, and
      calling at a house, begged for a glass of water. The woman who lived there
      said that she was sorry she could not give him water to drink, as there
      was a child in the house unbaptised, and therefore it would be unlucky.
      The origin of this superstition it is difficult to trace.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are some of the legends and superstitions which linger amongst us.
      Every neighbourhood has its stories, its legends, and romantic histories.
      It is a sad pity that these should pass away without any record being
      made. Many curious customs and ceremonies relating to christenings,
      marriages, and burials linger in remote hamlets; and charms, curious
      remedies, and other relics of the quaint superstitions of our forefathers,
      are full of interest to the lover of our English villages.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we walk in the fields, or study the old map of the parish, the names of
      the fields invite our attention. These are full of interest, and often
      tell us about matters which would be entirely forgotten. Some names tell
      us of the great forests which used to exist all over the country, when
      kings and noblemen, outlaws and poachers, used to hunt the deer and the
      wild boars in many a successful run. These forests were large tracts of
      country in its natural state, partly wood, partly heather and grass, which
      were owned by the king, and were especially brought under the harsh forest
      laws of the Norman sovereigns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of our field-names remind us of the existence of these old forests
      where corn now grows, and also of swamps and islands where everything now
      is dry and far removed from water. Sometimes they tell us of the old
      common lands which used to be farmed by the villeins and borderers, and of
      the strange way in which they used to manage their farming. Each man used
      to keep one or more oxen for the village plough until they made up the
      team into eight; then they ploughed the land in strips of an acre or
      half-acre each, divided by a bit of unploughed turf called a balk. Each
      strip was a furlong, <i>i.e.</i> a &ldquo;furrow long,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>
      the length of the drive of a plough before it is turned. This was forty
      rods, or poles, and four of these furrows made up the acre. These pieces
      of land were called &ldquo;shots,&rdquo; and there were &ldquo;headlands,&rdquo;
      or common field-ways, to each shot; and &ldquo;gored acres,&rdquo; which
      were corners of the fields which could not be cut up into strips, and odds
      and ends of unused land, which were called &ldquo;No Man&rsquo;s Land,&rdquo;
      or &ldquo;Jack&rsquo;s Land.&rdquo; It is curious, too, that all the
      strips belonging to one man did not lie together, but were scattered all
      over the common land, which must have been a very inconvenient arrangement
      for farming purposes. There were also in each village community a
      blacksmith, whose duty it was to keep in repair the ironwork of the
      village ploughs, a carpenter for the woodwork, and a pound-keeper, or
      punder, who looked after the stray cattle. Many of the &ldquo;balks&rdquo;
      still remain on the hillsides where these old common lands existed, and
      the names of the fields bear witness to the prevalence of this old field
      system.
    </p>
    <p>
      They tell us, too, of the way in which attempts were made to force the
      growth of particular crops, and in many parishes you will find a &ldquo;flax
      piece,&rdquo; which reminds us of a foolish Act of Henry VIII. ordering
      the cultivation of that plant. Metals, too, which have long ago been
      worked out, and trades which no longer exist, have left their traces
      behind in the names of our lanes and fields. Also they speak of the early
      days when the wolf or the bear might be seen in our woods or fields, or of
      the beaver which loved the quietude of our streams, of the eagle which
      carried off the lambs undisturbed by sound of the keeper&rsquo;s gun.
      Sometimes he was disturbed in his thefts by the flight of a good strong
      English arrow, which came from a sturdy English bow drawn by a good strong
      English arm. The English archers were famous everywhere, and many a battle
      has been won by their valour and their skill. A law was passed in the
      reign of Edward IV. that every Englishman should have a bow of his own
      height, and that butts for the practice of archery should be set up in
      every village; and every man was obliged to shoot up and down on every
      feast-day, or be fined one halfpenny. Consequently, in some villages we
      find a field called &ldquo;The Butts,&rdquo; where this old practice took
      place.[<a href="#linkb11">11</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Many villages are associated with the lives of distinguished men&mdash;authors,
      soldiers, and statesmen. Perhaps your village may have bred other poets
      besides &ldquo;the mute inglorious Milton&rdquo; of Gray&rsquo;s <i>Elegy</i>.
      Not far from where I am writing was Pope&rsquo;s early home, the village
      of Binfield, which he calls&mdash;

      On the other side lies the village of Three Mile Cross, where Miss Mitford
      lived and wrote &ldquo;Our Village&rdquo;; and Arborfield, called in her
      book Arborleigh, about which she tells some pleasant stories, is the
      adjoining parish. Sometimes, as I ride down a grassy lane, a favourite
      haunt of the distinguished authoress, I seem to see her seated on a fallen
      tree weaving her pretty romances, while her favourite dog, which she often
      describes, plays and barks around her. A few miles in another direction
      lies Eversley, the loved abode of Charles Kingsley, about whom many
      stories linger in the countryside. To visit the uncomfortable brick-paved
      study where he wrote, the garden where he used to pace and think out his
      great thoughts, is delightfully refreshing and invigorating to a jaded
      writer.

    <p>
      These are only instances of places which have become interesting on
      account of the famous men who once lived in them; and England has many
      heroes of the sword and pen whose lives each Englishman should study; and
      when you visit their dwelling-places you will recall their achievements,
      and perhaps endeavour to imitate their examples. Here is an instance of
      how little the villagers know of the distinguished men who once lived
      amongst them. The great Duke of Wellington did not live a very long time
      ago, and yet some friends of mine who were staying at Strathfieldsaye,
      near the Iron Duke&rsquo;s house, and made inquiries amongst the villagers
      about their recollections of the hero of Waterloo, could obtain no
      information. At last one venerable rustic vouchsafed the extraordinary
      intelligence, &ldquo;I believe as &rsquo;ow &rsquo;e were very good at war&rdquo;!
      What a thing it is to be famous!
    </p>
    <p>
      Much more remains to be said upon the various subjects which this history
      of our village suggests. But the day is closing, and our walk through its
      sequestered lanes and our thoughts about the various scenes which yonder
      venerable oaks have witnessed, must cease. But enough has been said to
      show what a wealth of interest lies beneath the calm exterior of ordinary
      village life. An American truly observes that everything in the rural life
      of England is associated with ideas of order, of quiet, sober,
      well-established principles, of hoary usage, and reverent custom&mdash;the
      growth of ages of regular and peaceful existence. The impression which the
      appearance of an English village left on his mind is beautifully described
      in the following passage:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old church of remote architecture with its low, massive portal,
      its gothic tower, its windows rich with tracery and painted glass, its
      scrupulous preservation, its stately monuments of warriors and worthies of
      olden times, ancestors of the present lords of the soil; its tombstones,
      recording successive generations of sturdy yeomanry, whose progeny still
      plough the same fields, and kneel at the same altar; the parsonage, a
      quaint, irregular pile, partly antiquated, but repaired and altered in the
      tastes of various eyes and occupants; the stile and footpath leading from
      the churchyard, across pleasant fields, and along shady hedgerows,
      according to an immemorial right-of-way; the neighbouring village, with
      its venerable cottages, its public green sheltered by trees, under which
      the forefathers of the present race have sported; the antique family
      mansion, standing apart in some little rural domain, but looking down with
      a protecting air on the surrounding scene. All these common features of
      English landscape evince a calm and settled security, and hereditary
      transmission of homebred virtues and local attachments, that speak deeply
      and touchingly for the moral character of the nation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most distressing features of modern village life is the
      continual decrease of its population. All our young men flock to the
      towns, attracted by the greater excitement which town life offers, as
      compared with the more homely pleasures of the country. The rural exodus
      is an alarming and very real danger to the welfare of social England.
      Agricultural machinery has greatly diminished the number of labourers
      required on a farm. Agricultural depression and the decreased value of
      land have caused many old country families to close their old
      manor-houses, as they cannot afford to live on their estates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us hope that those whose happy lot it is to live in the quiet hamlets
      of our native land, afar from the noise and din of busy towns, will learn
      to love more deeply their village homes, and interest themselves in their
      surroundings. To those who read the history of their native place, each
      house and field, each stone and tree, will tell its story, and recount the
      wonders it has witnessed. And as the stories of wars and fights, of
      superstition and of crime, fall on our ears, we shall be thankful that our
      lot is cast in more peaceful days, when no persecutions, religious or
      political, disturb the tranquillity of our village life. And when we read
      of the piety and simplicity of our forefathers, their veneration of their
      church, their love of home, their innocent joys and social customs, we
      should strive to imitate their virtues which have materially helped to
      make England a great and powerful nation. It is hoped that these chapters
      upon the old life of our country, and the manners and customs of our
      forefathers, may induce many of my readers to read and study history more
      deeply, may serve to create an interest in the relics that remain to us of
      the past, and to preserve the fleeting traditions that Time doth
      consecrate.

    <h3>
      BOOKS AND DOCUMENTS RELATING TO PAROCHIAL HISTORY
    </h3>
    <p>
      To anyone who sets himself the task of writing a history of his village,
      the following notes may be useful. With regard to the etymology of the
      name, concerning which absurd errors are made in most guide books and old
      county histories, it would be well to consult Canon Taylor&rsquo;s <i>Words
      and Places</i>, being careful to study the earliest form of the word in <i>Domesday</i>
      and old documents. Bede&rsquo;s <i>History</i>, the <i>Anglo-Saxon
      Chronicles</i>, and other old English chronicles, published by Bohn, may
      contain some allusions to the parish and neighbourhood, and also Kemble&rsquo;s
      <i>Saxons in England</i>. The <i>Domesday Book</i> is, of course, a mine
      of wealth. The Public Record Office contains many documents which will be
      of great service&mdash;the <i>Testa de Neville</i> (Edward II.), <i>Marshall
      Rolls, Nonarum Inquisitiones, Pipe Rolls, Patent Rolls, Close Rolls,
      Hundred Rolls, Inquisitiones post-mortem</i>, and the <i>Feet of Fines</i>.
      The <i>Manor Court Rolls</i>, if they still exist, in the custody of the
      lord of the manor, should also be consulted. The journals of local
      antiquarian societies and county histories will of course be examined. The
      history of the families connected with the parish must be traced. The
      British Museum and the College of Arms contain fine collections of <i>Heralds&rsquo;
      Visitations</i>, and Burke&rsquo;s <i>Landed Gentry</i> and Dugdale&rsquo;s
      <i>Baronage</i> are the chief sources of information. Old <i>wills</i>
      will yield much information, many of which are in course of publication by
      the Index Society, and county archaeolgical journals; and Somerset House
      and many diocesan registries contain the original documents. The
      Historical Manuscripts Commission has published many volumes of borough
      records which are of great service, and the lives of any great men
      connected with the parish may be studied in the <i>Dictionary of National
      Biography</i>. As we have already pointed out, the parish chest contains
      valuable sources of information upon the history of the village, and its
      contents should be carefully examined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The registers of the diocese contain many documents relating to the
      ecclesiastical history of the parish, and from them we can obtain a list
      of the rectors or vicars. If the church was connected with any monastery,
      Dugdale&rsquo;s <i>Monasticon</i> will furnish some information. The
      Public Record Office contains the documents <i>Taxatio Ecclesiastica P.
      Nicholai IV.</i> and <i>Valor Ecclesiasticus</i>, which give an account of
      the value of the first-fruits and tenths, and also some volumes on the
      sale of chantries, and the inventories of church goods. The name of the
      saint to whom the church is dedicated must not always be accepted, in
      spite of years of usage, and should be confirmed by reference to some
      early will of a chief person of the village buried in the church, which
      usually gives the name of the patron saint. The story of the church writ
      in stone should be traced by the various styles of architecture, with the
      help of Rickman&rsquo;s <i>Gothic Architecture</i> or Parker&rsquo;s <i>Glossary
      of Gothic Architecture</i>. If there has ever been a monastery in the
      parish, Dugdale&rsquo;s <i>Monasticon</i> should be consulted; and if
      there are any remains of a castle, Clark&rsquo;s <i>Mediaeval Military
      Architecture in England</i> will be useful. Prehistoric remains, such as
      barrows, earthworks, pit dwellings, and caves should be described; also
      any Roman roads and villas; the flora and fauna of the neighbourhood,
      geology, folklore, and dialect.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
